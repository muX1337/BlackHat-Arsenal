# Lynis

### Description
Lynis is a security auditing for UNIX derivatives like Linux, macOS, BSD, and others. It performs an in-depth security scan and runs on the system itself. The primary goal is to test security defenses and provide tips for further system hardening. It will also scan for general system information, vulnerable software packages, and possible configuration issues. Lynis was commonly used by people in the "blue team" to assess the security defenses of their systems. Nowadays, penetration testers also have Lynis in their toolkit.
