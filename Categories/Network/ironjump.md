# IronJump

## Description
IronJump is an automated SSH bastion management system that provides secure, automated, and scalable remote access control in IT, OT, and cloud environments. Built entirely in Bash, IronJump enables rapid deployment of jump hosts, enforces strict authentication policies, and streamlines user and endpoint management through a centralized bastion architecture. Initially designed for security consultants to perform penetration testing remotely, the project can be easily adapted to any task that requires remote management, such as consulting, network-based operations (honeypot, monitoring, taping, troubleshooting), pentesting, architecture assessments, troubleshooting in low-resource or restricted environments, and even everyday IT and OT administration in segregated networks. A simplified command-line GUI navigates administrators of all skill levels through the complexities of bastion management, endpoint deployment, and strict user management. Gain SSH access to a fully configured host in any target environment in as little as 5 minutes. Perfect for drop boxes, Remote Access Terminals (RATs), network monitors, quick remote access, security testing, or troubleshooting.
