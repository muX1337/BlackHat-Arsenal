# tty2web - Share your terminal as a web application (bind/reverse)

## Description
tty2web can take any console program and convert it into a web application. It provides a proper console for your shell needs directly inside your browser, which means programs like vim, mc, or any program that needs tty will work as expected by default. Features include support for both bind and reverse mode, which is useful for penetration testing and NAT traversal, bidirectional file transfer, reverse SOCKS 5 functionality by emulating the regeorg interface, and API support for executing commands (imagine having a RESTful interface to your operating system shell). It supports collaboration and sharing between teams, is multiplatform, and runs well on Unix/Linux-based OSs running container payloads. It is based on gotty but has been heavily improved for security and penetration tester needs.
