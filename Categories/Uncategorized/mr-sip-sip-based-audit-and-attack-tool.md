# Mr. SIP: SIP-Based Audit and Attack Tool

## Description
Mr.SIP is a functional SIP-based penetration testing tool. It is the most comprehensive offensive VoIP security tool ever developed. Mr.SIP is developed to assist security experts and system administrators who want to perform security tests for VoIP systems and to measure and evaluate security risks. It quickly discovers all VoIP components and services in a network topology along with vendor, brand, and version information, and detects current vulnerabilities, and configuration errors. It provides an environment to assist in performing advanced attacks to simulate abuse of detected vulnerabilities. It detects SIP components and existing users on the network, intervenes, filters, and manipulates call information, develops various DoS attacks, including status-controlled, breaks user passwords, and can test the server system by sending irregular messages.

In the current state, Mr.SIP comprises 9 sub-modules named SIP-NES (network scanner), SIP-ENUM (enumerator), SIP-DAS (DoS attack simulator), SIP-ASP (attack scenario player), SIP-EVA (eavesdropper), SIP-SIM (signaling manipulator), SIP-CRACK (cracker), SIP-SNIFF (sniffer), and SIP-FUZZ (fuzzer).
