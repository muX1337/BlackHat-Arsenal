# (Evil)Doggie: A modular open-source CAN bus research and penetration testing tool

## Description
Doggie is a modular, flexible, open-source adapter that bridges the gap between a computer and a CAN Bus network using USB or Bluetooth. It was built with affordability and adaptability in mind.

Its compatibility with SocketCAN, Python-can, and other slcan-compatible software ensures seamless integration with existing CAN Bus analysis, sniffing, and injection tools on different operating systems. Doggie also supports ISO-TP, making it perfect for standard and advanced CAN Bus applications. Whether running diagnostics, experimenting with custom in-car functionalities, or performing penetration tests, Doggie provides the tools you need to succeed.

EvilDoggie is the offensive firmware variant of Doggie with a set of techniques to expand the device's capabilities for low-level CAN bus research. It implements frame, protocol, and physical attacks for CAN, including spoofing, double receive, and bus takeover attacks.

The project emphasizes modularity, allowing users to select from various hardware configurations using different microcontrollers and CAN transceivers, making it accessible and cost-effective.
