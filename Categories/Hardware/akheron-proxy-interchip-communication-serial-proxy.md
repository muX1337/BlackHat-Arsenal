# Akheron Proxy - Interchip communication serial proxy

## Description
Akheron proxy is a serial communication proxy application tool designed to connect and proxy serial communication between microprocessors on a hardware circuit board. This live demonstration walks through how Akheron proxy allows embedded device testers to capture, decode, replay, and fuzz serial communications flowing between microprocessors on an embedded device circuit board in real time.
