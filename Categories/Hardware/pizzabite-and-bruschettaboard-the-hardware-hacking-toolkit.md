# PIZZABITE and BRUSCHETTABOARD: The Hardware Hacking Toolkit

## Description
In the last decade we have witnessed the emerging of a new era of connected devices. With this new trend, we also faced a security knowledge gap that in the recent years emerged respect to the (I)IoT landscape. The lack of a properly-defined workflow to approach a security audit of (I)IoT devices and the lack of technical expertise among security personnel in relation to embedded hardware security worsen this gap even further. To bring some clarity and order to this complicated and variegated matter It has been developed PIZZAbite & BRUSCHETTA-board: an all-in-one hardware hacking toolkit that can be considered the swiss-army-knife of any hardware hacker.

BRUSCHETTA-board is the latest device of the so-called WHID's CyberBakery family. It all started in 2019 from a personal need. The idea was to have a board that could gather in one single solution mutliple tools used by hardware hackers to interact with IoT and Embedded targets. It is the natural evolution of the other boards already presented in the past at BlackHat Arsenal: Focaccia-Board, Burtleina-Board and NANDo-Board. It has been designed for any hardware hacker out there that is looking for a fairly-priced all-in-one debugger & programmer that supports: UART, JTAG, I2C & SPI protocols and allows to interact with different targets' voltages (i.e., 1.8, 2.5, 3.3 and 5 Volts!).

PIZZAbite is a cheaper and open-hardware version of a commercial PCB holder, perfect for probing & holding your PCB while soldering or inspection. The PIZZAbite PCB probes are mounted on flexible metal arm and a powerful magnet in the base for easy positioning. The one of the kind "lift and drop" function takes away the need for annoying and complicated set screws. Thanks to the extreme flexibility of the arms connected to the PIZZAbite PCBs, the compressible needle (a.k.a. PogoPin) maintain constant pressure at the probing point so even if the board is bumped into the probe tip will always stay in position.

In this presentation, we will review with practical examples how PIZZAbite & BRUSCHETTA-board work against real IoT devices.
