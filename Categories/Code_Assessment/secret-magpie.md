# Secret Magpie

## Description
Secret Magpie is a secret scanning tool that leverages Gitleaks and TruffleHog as a backend for bulk scanning git repositories within organizations such as GitHub, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps, etc in order to produce machine readable and human friendly output. Secret Magpie is able to provide a web based UI for quickly filtering through the results from the backend tools to help with quickly eliminating false positives and identifying the most likely place secrets will be found.
