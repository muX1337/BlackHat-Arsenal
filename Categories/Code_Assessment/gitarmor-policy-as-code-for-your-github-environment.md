# GitArmor: policy as code for your GitHub environment

## Description
DevOps security does not only mean protecting the code, but also safeguarding the entire DevOps platform against supply chain attacks, integrity failures, pipelines injections, outsider permissions, worst practices, missing policies and more.

DevOps platforms like GitHub can easily grow in repos, actions, tokens, users, organizations, issues, PRs, branches, runners, teams, wiki, making admins' life impossible. This means also lowering the security of such environment.

GitArmor is a policy as code tool, that helps companies,teams and open-source creators, evaluate and enforce their GitHub (only for now) security posture at repository or organization level. Using policies defined using yml, GitArmor can run as CLI, GitHub action or GitHub App, to unify visibility into DevOps security posture and strengthen resource configurations as part of the development cycle.
