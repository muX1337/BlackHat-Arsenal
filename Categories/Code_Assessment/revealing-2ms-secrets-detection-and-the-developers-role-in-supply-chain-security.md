# Revealing 2MS: Secrets Detection and the Developer's Role in Supply Chain Security

## Description
Secrets belong in vaults, not in source code. Too Many Secrets (2MS) is a fast and reliable open-source CLI tool to help security teams and developers detect and remediate exposed secrets before they lead to security breaches. With support for scanning internal communication platforms, content management systems, and code repositories, 2MS proactively prevents credential leaks and strengthens security posture.
