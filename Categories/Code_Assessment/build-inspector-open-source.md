# Build Inspector Open Source

## Description
Build Inspector provides processing of plain-text CI/CD build and deployment logs with an eye towards identifying consumed and produced dependencies, along with identifying actions that introduce additional risk into the process. Quickly identify changes from one pipeline run to the next, and home in on spots where developers have added unnecessary risk or are performing actions that could be opportunities for a supply chain compromise.
