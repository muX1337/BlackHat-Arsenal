# Bugsy - Automated Vulnerability Remediation CLI

## Description
Bugsy is a command-line interface (CLI) tool that provides automatic security vulnerability remediation for your code. It is a community edition version of Mobb, the first vendor-agnostic automatic security vulnerability remediation tool. Bugsy is designed to help developers easily identify and fix security vulnerabilities in their code.

When pointed at an open-source repo, Bugsy will automatically scan the repo using Snyk Code and produce fixes the developer can easily review and commit.
