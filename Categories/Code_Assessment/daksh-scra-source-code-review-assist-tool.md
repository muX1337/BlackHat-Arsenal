# Daksh SCRA (Source Code Review Assist Tool)

## Description
Daksh SCRA is an open source tool that assists with manual source code review by providing helpful information to the code reviewer. This tool differs from traditional code review tools because it aims to help reviewers collect various details about the code base and identify areas of interest to review and confirm potential vulnerabilities. Even if code reviewers use automated code review tools, there are still many manual tasks they must perform to confirm findings and ensure precision in the code review process.

Although there are numerous automated code review tools available, none of them can perform a reconnaissance of the code base and provide code reviewers with useful insights. Typically, code reviewers must search for relevant information to confirm findings or ensure precision. Daksh SCRA offers valuable information such as technology and platform usage, functionalities, use cases, vulnerable patterns, and libraries used, among other data.

While most code review tools search for vulnerable patterns, they often report a high percentage of false positives. Daksh SCRA, on the other hand, is designed to be a reconnaissance tool that provides code reviewers with maximum insights about the target code base to assist with precise code review. Although Daksh SCRA is in its infancy stage, it is still a usable tool that supports a wide range of languages and platforms, and new features will be added in future releases.
