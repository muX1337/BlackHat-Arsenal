# The Dependency Combobulator

## Description
The Dependency Combobulator is a modular and extensible framework to detect and prevent dependency confusion leakage and potential attacks. This facilitates a holistic approach for ensure secure application releases that can be evaluated against different sources (e.g., GitHub, Artifactory) and many package management schemes (e.g., ndm, pip, maven).

The framework can be used by security auditors, pentesters and even baked into an enterprise's application security program and release cycle in an automated fashion.

This major new release will include support for a new line of package schemes / artifact ingestion.
