# CodeTotal: Shift Left Just Became Easier

## Description
Looking for a powerful and easy-to-use open-source scanning tool? CodeTotal is your solution! CodeTotal is an online scanning tool aggregates multiple open-source scanning tools, providing free and lightning-fast code scanning.

But CodeTotal offers much more than just speed and convenience. Our unique tool also aggregates the data from these scans, enabling users to identify any security issues that their current scanning software may have missed. With CodeTotal, you can even verify alerts suspected to be possible false positives, getting a valuable second opinion that can help you stay ahead of any potential threats.

Tired of maintaining multiple tool environments for each repository? CodeTotal offers a simple and streamlined solution. No more wasting time setting up and maintaining 10 to 20 tool environments - CodeTotal takes care of everything for you. Our revolutionary tool allows developers to independently scan their code for security issues in minutes, freeing up valuable resources and avoiding the need for involvement or approval from R&D and DevOps.

But that's not all. CodeTotal also produces an SBOM, giving developers a detailed view of their code dependencies and ensuring that any licensing issues are immediately flagged. With CodeTotal, you can use open-source libraries confidently and with peace of mind.
