# Damn Vulnerable Bank

## Description
With over 2.5 billion devices and millions of apps, Android is ruling the market. Developers had additional responsibility to protect the information and integrity of their users. Considering these high numbers, preventive measures should be taken to secure Android applications used by people across the globe.

We built an open-source vulnerable Banking application, a clone close to real-world banking applications. The existing vulnerable applications cover only basic OWASP vulnerabilities. Our vulnerable application covers multiple things like Binary analysis, Debugger detection bypasses, Frida analysis, writing custom code to decrypt data, and a lot more along with basic OWASP vulnerabilities. This product will be a one-stop place for android application security enthusiasts.
