# Chip In-depth Analysis - Where is the Key?

## Description
Chip-off forensics is an advanced digital data extraction and analysis technique which involves physically removing flash memory chips (IC) from a subject device and then acquiring the raw data using specialized equipment.

Apart from the rework station, it should have a suitable reader or device to retrieve the data/firmware from the chip.  It is an new developed device which can recognize the chip detailed information.  During the lab, the audiences would have opportunity to analyze the common eMMC / UFS chips and discover the secret from it.
