# ACVTool 2024 MultiDex

## Description
ACVTool is a sophisticated bytecode instrumentation tool designed for highlighting instruction coverage in Android apps. In 2024, ACVTool received a major update unlocking smali coverage analysis for modern Android apps. Now, ACVTool supports complex Multidex and Multi-APK applications that you can pull right from your Android device. With ACVTool we highlight exact bytecode instruction (in smali representation) executed when running a particular feature, e.g. to see the actually running code behind a tap of a button. To further depict selected app behavior, ACVTool may partially shrink not executed code. ACVTool works on 3rd-party Android apps without source code, and it does not require a rooted device.
