# Interactive Kubernetes Security Learning Playground - Kubernetes Goat

## Description
Kubernetes Goat is an interactive Kubernetes security learning playground. It has intentionally vulnerable by design scenarios to showcase the common misconfigurations, real-world vulnerabilities, and security issues in Kubernetes clusters, containers, and cloud native environments.

It's tough to learn and understand Kubernetes security safely, practically, and efficiently. So here we come to solve this problem not only for security researchers but also to showcase how we can leverage it for attackers, defenders, developers, DevOps teams, and anyone interested in learning Kubernetes security. We are also helping products & vendors to showcase their product or tool's effectiveness by using these playground scenarios and also help them to use this to educate their customers and organizations. This project is a place to share knowledge with the community in well-documented quality content in hands-on scenario approaches.
