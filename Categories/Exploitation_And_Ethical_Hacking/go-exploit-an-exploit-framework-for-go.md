# go-exploit: An Exploit Framework for Go

## Description
go-exploit is an exploit development framework for Go. The framework helps exploit developers create small, self-contained, portable, and consistent exploits.

Many proof-of-concept exploits rely on interpreted languages with complicated packaging systems. They implement wildly differing user interfaces, and have limited ability to be executed within a target network. Some exploits are integrated into massive frameworks that are burdened by years of features and dependencies which overwhelm developers and hinder the attacker's ability to deploy the exploits from unconventional locations.

To overcome these challenges, go-exploit offers a lightweight framework with minimal dependencies, written in Goâ€”a language renowned for its portability and cross-compilation capabilities. The framework strikes a balance between simplicity for rapid proof-of-concept development and the inclusion of sophisticated built-in features for operational use.
