# Morion - A Tool for Experimenting with Symbolic Execution on Real-World Binaries

## Description
Morion's modular design facilitates the seamless integration of custom symbolic analysis passes. It currently includes passes for detecting and analyzing control-flow and memory hijacking conditions, reasoning about code coverage, as well as assisting with the generation of ROP chains. Currently, Morion's implementation is restricted to ARMv7 binaries. However, the tool can be easily extended to support other architectures compatible with its underlying symbolic execution engine Triton.

Just a thanks to the authors for pointing to their githubs. <3
