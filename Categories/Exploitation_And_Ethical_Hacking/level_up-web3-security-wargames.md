# level_up! : Web3 Security WarGames

## Description
As we navigate the increasingly interconnected digital landscape, the dawn of Web3, or the decentralized web, marks a significant leap forward in internet technology. Powered by blockchain technology and smart contracts, Web3 promises unparalleled levels of decentralization, transparency, and user empowerment. However, with these new opportunities come novel challenges, and none are more pressing than security. While the decentralized nature of Web3 eliminates single points of failure characteristic of Web2 applications, it also introduces a unique set of vulnerabilities that require attention.

From exploitable smart contract code to sophisticated re-entrancy attacks, Web3's security threats pose significant financial and reputational risks, as demonstrated by high-profile hacking incidents in recent years. This underscores the critical need for a deep understanding of Web3 security. As a result, designing, developing, and operating secure Web3 applications and platforms have become essential skills in today's rapidly evolving digital terrain. Simply building on top of blockchain technologies is no longer enough; developers, cybersecurity experts, and even end-users must now grasp the fundamental principles of securing these systems to ensure a safe and trustworthy online environment.

The level_up! project is an open-source initiative aimed at teaching about security in Web3. It provides a platform featuring a system of challenges, categorized by difficulty level, where various Web3 concepts are presented, and points are earned upon successfully overcoming these challenges. The goal is learning. Users register on the platform and can deploy multiple SmartContracts. Each challenge might comprise one or more SmartContracts.
