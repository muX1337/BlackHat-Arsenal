# Invoke-DNSteal: Exfiltrating DNS information "Like a Boss"

## Description
One of the most common problems during Red Team and Ethical Hacking exercises is the possibility of sending information outside the perimeter of an organization without being detected.

Currently, there are a multitude of tools and techniques to perform this task (via HTTP/S, TCP, etc.) as well as the use of covert channels. These covert channels, allow us to send and receive information through protocols designed for other purposes, with the aim of disguising our traffic so as not to be discovered.

In this talk, we will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using the DNS protocol in an audit, the automation of this process from scratch, and even a new way of use never seen before or used by any other tool of this type.
