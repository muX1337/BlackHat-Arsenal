# Pandora: Exploit Password Management Software To Obtain Credential From Memory

## Description
Passwords comprise one of the cornerstones of cybersecurity since the early ages, with a plethora of attacks focusing on secretly acquiring user's passwords. Password management software (PM) has been developed as a key weapon for counteracting such attacks. However, despite the various protections implemented by this kind of software, misconfigurations and user's mistakes may still lead to sensitive data leaks.

For a methodological viewpoint, Pandora is based on each PM implementation. Basically, most PMs store their entries/master credentials in plaintext format within the corresponding memory processes. To this end, Pandora comprises different autonomous scripts based on each PM implementation.

After following a CVD process, most vendors responded that such issues are out of their scope, since the attacker needs local access, or the AV/EDR may be able to impede such attacks. Overall, until now, only two vendors have acknowledged the problem and one has already reserved a CVE ID, namely CVE-2023-23349 (Kaspersky).
