# GCP Scanner

## Description
Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a rapidly growing cloud infrastructure with millions of customers worldwide and more than a hundred of various products offered to them. While Cloud offers undeniable benefits in scalability, performance and security, it also opens new and unique challenges for security engineers working with Cloud. One such challenge is credential management.

Cloud credentials such as GCP service account (SA) key can open access to the most critical parts of cloud infrastructure. An incorrectly stored or leaked SA key with such permissions represents high interest for an attacker. Security engineers need to understand the impact of such key leak/compromise to draft a proper security response.

The main objective of GCP Scanner is to offer the community a tool that can be used to evaluate the security impact of a given cloud identity compromise. Security engineers can use this tool to assess the impact of a certain credentials leak, OAuth2 token, potential compromise of a GCP VM or Kubernetes pod.

By now, the only option available was to rely on heavy-weight solutions or time-consuming manual analysis that require privileged access to the affected GCP organization. In contrast, the GCP Scanner works with individual credentials and offers an easy-to-use solution that can be executed from various types of environments with just a single command.

In the demo, we will talk about the scanner architecture and show the audience on how to use the tool in various types of situations (leaked GCP service account key, compromised end-user credentials, VMs and Docker containers, standalone binary from any machine). We will also cover how the scanner can be used to evaluate whether a GCP SA key can be used to impersonate other service accounts and understand potential impact.
