# Foundpy: Foundry-like Interface for Interacting with Ethereum Application in Python

## Description
Foundpy is a Foundry-like interface for interacting with the Ethereum application as a single Python module. It's designed to be easy to use, just like Foundry's commands, but no installation of Foundry is required. This provides a streamlined experience for developers and security researchers.

Beyond basic Foundry replication, Foundpy incorporates specialized features designed for Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges. Which is inspired by the popular pwntools library, the combination of Foundry's friendly interface and the ease of use of CTF framework like pwntools is what makes it the best tool for beginners to learn blockchain security.
