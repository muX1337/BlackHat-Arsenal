# Gato

## Description
Gato, or the GitHub Attack Toolkit, is an enumeration and attack toolkit that allows both blue teamers and offensive security practitioners to identify and exploit GitHub Actions vulnerabilities within an organization's public and private repositories. Gato can automatically enumerate repositories and organizations for exploitable self-hosted runners, readable secrets, and insecure workflows that attackers could leverage for further compromise. Gato also automates the exploitation of these misconfigurations, including dumping secrets or executing commands on a runner.

The tool leverages GitHub personal access tokens, both compromised or provisioned, to perform enumeration and exploitation and aims to identify GitHub repositories where an attacker could execute code in a trusted context. Outcomes often include dumping sensitive GitHub repository variables, such as deploy keys, cloud credentials, or additional GitHub tokens, and code execution on self-hosted runners, commonly an initial access vector.

Key Features:

* Automated Enumeration: Gato rapidly scans GitHub repositories and organizations, pinpointing those with exploitable self-hosted runners or readable secrets.

* Exploitation Capabilities: Gato fully automates the execution of attacks against discovered misconfigurations, from secret dumping to command execution on Actions runners.

* Practical Value: Empowers red and blue teams to identify and fix critical vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.

* Attack Vector Focus: Zeroes in on GitHub Actions as a key infiltration point, often serving as an initial access point for wider breaches.
