# MUSHIKAGO-femto: Automated Pentest & First Aid Tool for IT/OT Environments

## Description
At the Black Hat USA 2021 Arsenal, we presented MUSHIKAGO, an automated penetration testing tool for both IT and OT. MUSHIKAGO can automatically perform penetration tests and post-exploitation in various environments without prior learning.

This time, we have newly evolved MUSHIKAGO as MUSHIKAGO-femto, incorporating cutting-edge features. The evolution includes the implementation of a mechanism to perform first aid on the tested system and acquire immune functions so that the same attack can be defended against attacks that could be achieved by penetration tests. A function was implemented to defend against vulnerability attacks by applying patches, injecting FW functions or proprietary IPS into terminals. Specifically, taking advantage of the fact that the penetration test was able to penetrate the system, patches are applied as if injecting a vaccine at the penetrated terminal, or a unique thin IPS is incorporated. This allows the system to be defended before the actual attacker can exploit the vulnerability or misconfiguration. Based on these results, MUSHIKAGO-femto has become the Next-Generation Pentest Tool that strengthens system defenses while performing penetration testing.

Other additional features include the implementation of a scan function to detect ICS protocols in order to detect ICS devices with high accuracy. MUSHIKAGO-femto has both Active Scan and Passive Scan functions, enabling comprehensive detection of PLCs and ICS devices. This enables automatic penetration of OT system. This makes it possible to perform automatic penetration tests on OT system with high accuracy. In the demo, we will show how it can perform automatic penetration testing and automatic protection against Hack THe Box and VulnHub machines. We will also show that it is possible to perform effective penetration testing in our OT/ICS environment.
