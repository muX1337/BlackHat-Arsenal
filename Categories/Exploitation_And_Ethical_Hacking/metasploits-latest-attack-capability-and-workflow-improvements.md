# Metasploit's Latest Attack Capability and Workflow Improvements

## Description
Metasploit continues to expand support for Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) attacks, as well as its protocol relaying capability and attack workflows for evergreen vulnerabilities. This year, we added support for SMB-to-LDAP relaying and SMB-to-HTTP relaying, as well as support to identify and exploit a number of AD CS flaws (i.e., ESC vulnerabilities). We've also added the new "PoolParty" process injection capability to Windows Meterpreter sessions, along with support for System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) attack workflows.

This demo will focus on obtaining an LDAP session via SMB relaying, which can then be used to identify ESC vulnerabilities through Metasploit's expanded ldap_vulnerable_cert_finder module. Using the results from the vulnerable cert finder module, we will demonstrate how to detect and exploit ESC15 (the newest ESC vulnerable certificate template flaw) in order to obtain a certificate that can be used to open a Windows Meterpreter session. While opening the Meterpreter session we will demonstrate using Sysmon how the Windows Meterpreter no longer makes calls to CreateRemoteThread and instead uses the PoolParty injection technique to more effectively inject into the target process.

Going back to our LDAP session, we will run a query to identify SCCM servers in the target Active Directory environment. Once identified, we will demonstrate Metasploit's new SCCM attack workflow, which leverages new SMB-to-HTTP relaying capabilities. Using Metasploit's SMB-to-HTTP relay server, we will relay an NTLM authentication attempt for a newly created computer account to the SCCM HTTP authentication server. After successfully authenticating, we will retrieve Network Access Account (NAA) credentials from the SCCM server, as these are often found in domain environments with higher privileges than they require making them a prime target for lateral movement.
