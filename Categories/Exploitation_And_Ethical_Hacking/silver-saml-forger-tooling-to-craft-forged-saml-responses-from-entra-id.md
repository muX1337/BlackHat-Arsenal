# Silver SAML Forger: Tooling to craft forged SAML responses from Entra ID

## Description
Silver SAML Forger is a tool developed to PoC SAML response forging, also known as Silver SAML and Golden SAML attacks, against applications federated to Entra ID for authentication using the SAML standard. The tool goes along with research into the vulnerabilities that can present in cloud identity providers, such as Entra ID, where if an attacker has access to the private key material Entra ID uses for SAML response signing, that the target applications may be susceptible to these forging attacks.

While Entra ID protects the private key if generated internally, as it cannot be exported, in the real-world organizations follow bad habits that may leave sensitive private key material available to an attacker. These sorts of habits have been observed by the research team that developed the Silver SAML Forger. Using this tool in combination with tools such as Burp Suite, you can demonstrate forging access to a target application. If the application supports certain types of SAML integrations, the identity provider will have no visibility into the authentication â€“ you could think of these attacks as Kerberos Golden-ticket type attacks.

The tool requires the signing certificate to use, the username that is target for impersonation, and some basic federation information about the target application that can be derived from a few different methods.
