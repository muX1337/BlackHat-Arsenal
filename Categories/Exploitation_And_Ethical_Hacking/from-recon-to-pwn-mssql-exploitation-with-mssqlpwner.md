# From Recon to Pwn: MSSQL Exploitation with MSSqlPwner

## Description
MSSqlPwner is a sophisticated penetration testing arsenal specifically engineered to dominate Microsoft SQL Server environments. Leveraging the extensive capabilities of the Impacket toolkit, MSSqlPwner arms penetration testers with a powerful suite of exploitation techniques, including authentication attacks using Kerberos tickets, NTLM hashes, and clear-text credentials. This versatile tool excels at advanced maneuvers such as NTLM relay attacks, Kerberos and NTLM password bruteforcing, and even direct password extraction via LDAP integrationâ€”transforming standard SQL servers into strategic entry points for escalating privileges and lateral network infiltration.
