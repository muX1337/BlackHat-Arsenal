# Warhead: Stealthy Payload Execution via Atom Tables

## Description
Warhead is an offensive security tool that leverages Windows Atom Tables to store, retrieve, and execute payloads in a stealthy manner. This technique enables adversaries to place a payload in the Atom Table, use a legitimate process to extract it, and execute it in memoryâ€”bypassing traditional detection mechanisms. The first version of Warhead, to be released at Black Hat Arsenal 2025, provides security researchers and red teamers with a novel approach to payload delivery and execution that evades modern security defenses.
