# HardeningMeter

## Description
HardeningMeter is an open-source Python tool carefully designed to comprehensively assess the security protections of binaries and systems. Its robust capabilities include thorough checks of various binary exploitation protection mechanisms, including Stack Canary, RELRO, Lazy Binding, PIE/PIC, None Exec Stack, Shadow Stack, IBT, Fortify and ASAN in binary files and ASLR, NX bit, SMEP, SMAP, PTI, IBT in the system.

Many of these mitigations cannot be detected by any existing open-source solutions. For the mitigations that can - HardeningMeter provides a much higher detection precision compared to existing tools.

The genesis of HardeningMeter stems from extensive research into the dynamic cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders when exploiting memory vulnerabilities. While certain protections are designed to thwart memory exploitation, resourceful attackers continue to find ways to circumvent these protections. HardeningMeter is a wake-up call that raises awareness of the critical need to protect against memory exploitation, monitors vulnerable binaries and systems that lack critical hardening, and promotes a broader understanding of the offensive research landscape.

HardeningMeter's uniqueness lies in its precision, which is based on a deep understanding of binary and system structures, exploitation techniques, and hardening mechanisms and was built to support all Linux systems and binary file types.

The tool offers a significant benefit to users, each check that the tool performs is documented in detail to allow users to dive into the inner workings of binary hardening. Users can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts, explore the intricacies of binary exploitation protection mechanisms, and expand their knowledge in this important area. Moreover, users can set the output to receive tailored recommendations on which binary files require heightened attention and monitoring.

We hope to contribute to the cybersecurity community and benefit from their ideas and perceptions to make HardeningMeter a better tool that supports all Operating Systems.
