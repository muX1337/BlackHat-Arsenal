# The Go-Exploit Framework

## Description
The Go-Exploit framework helps exploit developers rapidly develop advanced exploits in the Go programming language. In this talk, we will demonstrate advanced features of the framework such as integration with Shodan, scanning and exploiting through a proxy (including Tor), using Meterpreter and Sliver payloads, using the built-in encrypted reverse shell, adding custom C2, spinning up LDAP JNDI infrastructure, and easily cross compiling to different OS and architectures.

This talk will focus on real-world exploitation and, as such, we will release go-exploit exploits for CVE-2023-46604 (ActiveMQ), CVE-2023-25194 (Druid), and CVE-2022-47966 (Various Manage Engine).
