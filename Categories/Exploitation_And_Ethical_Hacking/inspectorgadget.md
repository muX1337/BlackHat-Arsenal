## Description
The RISC-V Instruction-Set Architecture is a novel ISA open to academia and industry. It is also extensible, meaning anyone can customize the final processor to their specific needs. One of the standard extensions, called C extension, or Compressed Extension, allows for variable-length instructions, much like x86, but with far fewer degrees of freedom: only 2-byte and 4-byte instruction lengths; in contrast to x86, whose instruction encoding goes from 1 to 16 bytes. Although the ISA is ready for multiple 2-byte instructions to be created. This flexibility raises concerns regarding Code Reuse Attacks (CRA) such as Return Oriented Programming (ROP) and Jump-Oriented Programming (JOP) that have been widely exploited in x86 architecture.

This tool, inspectorGadget, assesses the attack surface of binaries compiled to RISC-V architecture. Searching through pre-compiled binaries, particularly of standard operating systems services, it can find useful ROP/JOP functional gadgets for those needing to craft a manual payload or deeply analyze the available gadgets. It delivers a gadget's availability analysis based on some classification groups, depending on the gadget's type of computation (arithmetic operations, register-to-register data movement, load/store operation, control flow, etc.). We also try to find the initializer and dispatcher special gadgets for JOP attacks that follow the dispatcher gadget paradigm. We also strive to link the gadgets utilizing a novel technique.

In any stage of a development pipeline, inspectorGadget can be used to assess the likelihood that a hacker could use the available gadgets to craft a CRA attack. This tool doesn't cover the first step of the exploit, which is related to some memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer-overflows, format strings, use-after-free, etc. It can also be valuable to test the defense mechanism, assuming that the attacker is able to perform the first step and subsequently needs to rely on CRA, possibly due to using some code injection countermeasures like NX/XD/DEP.
