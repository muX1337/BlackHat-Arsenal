# BOAZ: Development of a Multilayered Evasion Tool and Methodology

## Description
BOAZ (Bypass, Obfuscate, Adapt, Zero-Trust) evasion was inspired by the concept of multi-layered approach which is the evasive version of defence-in-depth first proposed by  at BH USA14 [1]. BOAZ was developed to provide greater control over combinations of evasion methods, enabling more granular evaluations against antivirus and EDR. It is designed to bypass both before and during execution detections that span signature, heuristic and behavioural detection techniques [2].

BOAZ supports both x86/x64 binary (PE) or raw payload as input and output EXE or DLL. It has been tested on separated Window-11 Enterprise, Windows-10 and windows Server 2022 VMs (version: 22H2, 22621.1992) with 14 Desktop AVs and 7 EDRs installed include Windows Defender, Norton, BitDefender, Sophos and ESET. The design of BOAZ evasion is modular, so users can add their own toolset or techniques to the framework. One advantage of this approach is that if a specific technique's signature become known to antivirus, researchers can easily adjust the technique to verify it and either improve or target a new technique to that detection. This process is described as a query-modify-query attack process, where the attacker can improve based on the feedback from black-box engines until their sample is fully undetectable (FUD) [3].

BOAZ is written in C++ and C and uses Python3 as the main linker to integrate all modules.  There have been significant improvements implemented since its inception. The new features of the BOAZ evasion tool, set to be released at BH Asia 2025, include two novel process injection primitives, along with newly implemented loaders and behavioural evasion techniques. There will be a major update to the BH USA 2025 version, including some new anti-forensic techniques and more new process injection threadless execution primitives.
