# EmoLoad: Loading Emotet Modules without Emotet

## Description
Emotet is one of the most prominent multi-component threats in recent years. Besides the core component, which is often attached to a spam email or downloaded from a malicious URL, Emotet is known to retrieve from its C2 infrastructure additional modules; these modules can be either designed to propel its own operations by, for example, stealing email credentials to be used in future spam waves, or, when the attack is more targeted, engineered to be more a destructive artifact, like ransomware provided by an affiliated group.

These additional components are meant to be executed by the core module directly from memory, and they are never dropped on disk. Even when payload extraction using dynamic analysis techniques succeeds, loading the extracted modules in isolation inexorably fails as the existence of a custom entry point requires specially crafted data structures to be allocated in memory. These data structures are normally allocated by the core module for various purposes, with only a portion being required by the loaded module.

EmoLoad is a small but practical tool to successfully execute Emotet modules in isolation. It allocates the required data structures and invokes the custom entry point while allowing customization of the execution environment. It easily allows dynamic analysis without depending on the core module potentially infecting the system, thereby enabling security research tasks such as debugging, IoC extraction, or analysis of the resulting network activity (critical when analyzing Emotet modules that are able to propagate laterally). To further simplify analysis at scale, EmoLoad offers an option to embed the module and the loader together into a standalone executable, making it the perfect candidate for automated submissions to standard sandboxes.
