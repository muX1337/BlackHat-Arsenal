# Abusing Microsoft SQL Server with SQLRecon

## Description
In November 2022, Kaspersky Lab publicly released research which outlined that reoccurring attacks against Microsoft SQL Server rose by 56% (https://usa.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/2022_kaspersky-finds-reoccurring-attacks-using-microsoft-sql-server-rise-by-56-in-2022).

I'd like to share a tool I wrote called SQLRecon, which will demonstrate how adversaries are leveraging Microsoft SQL services to facilitate with furthering their presence within enterprise networks through privilege escalation and lateral movement. I will also share defensive considerations which organizations can practically implement to mitigate attacks. I feel that this will add a fresh perspective on the various ancillary services within enterprise Windows networks which are under less scrutiny, however still ripe for abuse.

For red team operators, SQLRecon helps address the post-exploitation tooling gap by modernizing the approach operators can take when attacking SQL Servers. The tool is written in C#, rather than long-standing existing tools that use PowerShell or Python. SQLRecon has been designed with operational security and detection avoidance in mind â€“ with a special focus on stealth, reconnaissance, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. The tool was designed to be modular, allowing for ease of extensibility from the hacker community. SQLRecon is compatible stand-alone or within a diverse set of command and control (C2) frameworks (Cobalt Strike, Nighthawk, Mythic, PoshC2, Sliver, Havoc, etc). When using the latter, SQLRecon can be executed either in-process, or through traditional fork and run.

Furthermore, I will be releasing a new version, one that is currently only used internally on advanced red team engagements by IBM X-Force Red's Adversary Services team.
