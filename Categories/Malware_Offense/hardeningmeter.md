# HardeningMeter

## Description
HardeningMeter is an open-source Python tool carefully designed to comprehensively assess the security hardening of binaries and systems. Its robust capabilities include thorough checks of various binary exploitation protection mechanisms, including Stack Canary, RELRO, randomizations (ASLR, PIC, PIE), None Exec Stack, Fortify, ASAN, NX bit. This tool is suitable for all types of binaries and provides accurate information about the hardening status of each binary, identifying those that deserve attention and those with robust security measures.

The genesis of HardeningMeter stems from extensive research into the dynamic cat-and-mouse game between attackers and defenders when exploiting binaries. While certain binary hardening measures are designed to thwart binary exploitation, resourceful attackers continue to find ways to circumvent these protections. HardeningMeter is a wake-up call that raises awareness of the critical need to protect against binary exploitation, monitors vulnerable binaries that lack critical hardening, and promotes a broader understanding of the offensive research landscape.

HardeningMeter's uniqueness lies in its precision, which is based on a deep understanding of binary structures, exploitation techniques, and hardening mechanisms. It supports all binary file types, including executables, dynamic executables, dynamic shared objects, relocatables, and statically linked files.

The tool offers a significant benefit to users, each check that the tool performs is documented in detail to allow users to dive into the inner workings of binary hardening. Users can gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts, explore the intricacies of binary exploitation protection mechanisms, and expand their knowledge in this important area. Moreover, users can set the output to receive tailored recommendations on which binary files require heightened attention and monitoring.

We hope to contribute to the cybersecurity community and benefit from their ideas and perceptions to extend our features and make HardeningMeter a better tool that supports systems other than Linux in the future.
