# KICS - Your IaC Secure Now!

## Description
KICS stands for Keeping Infrastructure as Code Secure. It is open source and is a must-have for any cloud native project to find security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations early in the development cycle of the underlying infrastructure-as-code (IaC).

KICS supports about 20 different technologies including Terraform, Cloudformation, Kubernetes, Docker, over several cloud providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. It is the only open-source project that has achieved any Center for Internet Security (CIS) certification.

KICS is fully customizable and extensible by the addition of rules for new vulnerabilities. It is available as a Docker image, and is paired in multiple platforms to leverage its integration on the development life-cycle and the DevSecOps mentality of its users. Gitlab has chosen KICS as its default IaC scanner; it is also available in ArgoHub, as a hook in TerraformCloud or as a Github Action for Github workflows.

One of the most recent features of KICS is auto remediation. With this feature KICS goes full cycle in preventing vulnerable code from going into production by scanning the code, exposing the issues, and automatically remediating them. Such a feature is both available from the CLI interface, or via a plugin for the Visual Studio Code editor, where we bring together auto-remediation and real-time scanning. As the developer writes IaC scripts, KICS automatically looks for vulnerabilities, proposes fixes and remediates them. By the time the IaC scripts are finished, developers are rest assured that it is safe to go into production. This is shift-left security brought to its splendor.
