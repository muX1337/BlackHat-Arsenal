# Wabhawk/Catch - Unsupervised Machine Learning Detection

## Description
Webhawk/Catch helps automatically finding web attack traces in HTTP logs without using any preset rules. Based on the usage of Unsupervised Machine Learning, Catch groups log lines into clusters, and detects the outliers that it considers as potentially attack traces. The tool takes as input a raw HTTP log file (Apache, Nginx..) and returns a report with a list of findings.

Catch uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) technique to select the most relevant features (Example: user-agent, IP address, number of transmitted parameters, etc.. ). Then, it runs DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to get all the possible log line clusters and anomalous points (potential attack traces).

Advanced users can fine tune Catch based on a set of options that help optimising the clustering algorithm (Example: minimum number of points by cluster, or the maximum distance between two points within the same cluster).

The current version of Webhawk/Catch generates an easy-to-read HTML report which includes all the findings, and the severity of each one.
