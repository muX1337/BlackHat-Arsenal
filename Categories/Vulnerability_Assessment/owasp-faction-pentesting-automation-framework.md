# OWASP Faction - PenTesting Automation Framework

## Description
OWASP FACTION is an open-source solution for streamlined security assessment workflows and enhancing collaboration within your teams. In addition, It's robust and extendable so it can integrate within diverse environments.

FACTION's key benefits are that it cuts reporting time down to more than half for manual pen-tests, keeps tabs on all outstanding vulnerabilities with custom alerts based on your SLAs, becomes the hub of shared information for your assessments enabling other teammates to replay attacks you share, facilitates large scale assessment scheduling that typically becomes hard to manage when your teams are doing more than 100 assessments a year, and is fully extendable with REST APIs and FACTION Extensions.
