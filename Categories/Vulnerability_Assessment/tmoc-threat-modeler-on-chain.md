# TMoC: Threat Modeler on Chain

## Description
TMoC(Threat Modelers on Chain) is the blockchain-based threat modeling tool that can perform threat modeling using the collective intelligence of security experts. It provides better quality of threat modeling results to threat modeling players and those customer. And TMoC provide massive collaborative environment to threat modeling players via blockchain technology. Also, existing threat modeling automation tools enable rapid threat modeling according to DevOps, but TMoC is the first tool that utilizes collective intelligence.

Player of TMoC consists of customer, performer, evaluator, and arbiter. Customers who want to perform threat modeling by utilizing the collective intelligence of experts can start threat modeling by uploading a DFD(Data Flow Diagram). When someone uploads a DFD, experts can join the TMoC platform as performers or evaluators. A community of experts who participated as performers should perform the threat modeling process on the uploaded DFD. Performers can get a certain amount of tokens as incentives by adding new or critical items to the threat modeling process. However, all threat modeling processes are evaluated through evaluator. As a result of the evaluation, if inappropriate items are uploaded or duplicate items exist, the performer cannot obtain incentives. Evaluators can get a certain amount of tokens as incentives through such evaluation activities. In addition, to prevent the evaluator from conducting malicious or inappropriate evaluations, several arbiters are configured that act as watchers through the votes of the evaluators.

This reward model fosters a competitive environment that motivates experts to analyze better threat modeling results. This allows the threat modeling results to become more detailed as the number of TMoC participants increases, which can lead to better results.

Finally, TMoC is uploaded to github in the form of open source. In this presentation, we would like to tell you more about the developed tool and show you a demo.
