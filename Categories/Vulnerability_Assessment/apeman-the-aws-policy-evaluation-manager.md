# Apeman: The AWS Policy Evaluation Manager

## Description
Apeman is a tool designed to simplify the understanding of permissions and potential attack paths within an AWS (Amazon Web Services) environment for both attackers and defenders. AWS's permission model is inherently complex, featuring a detailed policy evaluation system, fine-grained policies, potentially conflicting statements, and various conditions. This complexity can make it challenging to manually determine which principals (users, roles, etc.) have permissions to perform certain actions, leading to a process that is not only tedious but also prone to errors. Apeman addresses this issue by modeling the AWS permission structure within a graph database. This approach enables it to provide an intuitive interface for users to navigate and obtain clear, precise answers about which principals can execute specific actions within the AWS environment. Essentially, it translates the intricate web of AWS permissions into a more understandable and visually navigable format. Furthermore, Apeman offers the capability to dynamically categorize principals into different tiers based on their permissions. Specifically, it can identify which principals or groups of principals are considered "Tier 0." This categorization is crucial because it highlights the principals with the most significant level of access or potential impact, thereby giving users a clearer understanding of the security posture of their AWS environment. By identifying these high-risk entities, Apeman can help identify which access points are the most crucial for securing or attacking an AWS environment.
