# C0deVari4nt

## Description
C0deVari4nt is a variant analysis and visualisation tool that inspects codebases for similar vulnerabilities. It leverages CodeQL, a semantic code analysis engine, to query code based on user-controlled CodeQL query templates and passes the results to Neo4j for further exploration and visualisation. This enables quick and comprehensive variant analysis based on previous vulnerability reports. The Neo4j visualisation feature provides additional insight for developers into vulnerable code paths and allows them to effectively triage potential variants.

The Log4Shell incident in December 2021 highlighted the difficulties open-source developers face in responding to vulnerability reports. After the initial patch for CVE-2021-44228, which allowed unauthenticated remote attackers to take control of devices running vulnerable versions of Log4j 2, Apache released 3 additional patches to address related vulnerabilities and unmitigated edge cases.

Open-source developers often lack training in comprehensive code review and face problems in identifying variants of a vulnerability, leading to incomplete patches. Although CodeQL query suites exist to facilitate quick analysis of the codebase, the results returned from these suites may result in significant false positive rates. Furthermore, these suites rely on predefined queries which do not support variant analysis and are not customised for individual codebases. As such, open-source projects often respond to vulnerability reports in a piecemeal manner that misses potential variants.

C0deVari4nt provides a platform for developers to easily conduct variant analysis without the significant overhead of writing their own CodeQL queries. This gives developers the flexibility to customise CodeQL templates by providing codebase-specific information such as a particular source and sink of a vulnerability. The results will be visualised in a simplified Neo4j graph for developers to quickly identify potential variants. As such, developers will be able to effectively address entire classes of bugs from a single vulnerability report.
