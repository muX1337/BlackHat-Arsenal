# kdigger: A Context Discovery Tool for Kubernetes Penetration Testing

## Description
kdigger, short for "Kubernetes digger", is a context discovery tool for Kubernetes penetration testing. This tool is a compilation of various plugins called buckets to facilitate pentesting Kubernetes from inside a pod.

The idea behind this tool is to quickly gather various information about your Kubernetes containerized environment, like a checklist, to give you, as a pentester, hints about the actual situation. For example, kdigger can help you:
- notice that you are running inside a privileged container;
- notice that you are running inside a container sharing the PID namespace with other container in its pod;
- verify if you have a Kubernetes API token at your disposition that has interesting capabilities;
- scan the admission control, if you have the right to create pods, in order to create a more privileged pod and escalate;
- retrieve all the available services running inside of the cluster you are in;
- scan the allowed system calls in the container.
