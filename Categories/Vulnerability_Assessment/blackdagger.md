# Blackdagger

## Description
Blackdagger represents a significant advancement, offering a comprehensive solution for orchestrating complex workflows in DevOps, DevSecOps, MLOps, MLSecOps, and Continuous Automated Red Teaming (CART) environments.

At its core, Blackdagger simplifies the management and execution of intricate workflows through its user-friendly approach and powerful functionality. Leveraging a declarative YAML format, Blackdagger enables users to define automation pipelines using a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), facilitating clear and concise expression of task dependencies and execution logic.

What sets Blackdagger apart is its simplicity and versatility. Unlike traditional cron-based schedulers or workflow orchestration platforms, Blackdagger eliminates the need for extensive scripting or coding. With a built-in Web UI, users can easily manage, rerun, and monitor automation pipelines in real-time, streamlining the workflow management process. Additionally, Blackdagger offers native Docker support, enabling seamless integration with containerized environments, and a versatile toolset for task execution, including making HTTP requests and executing commands over SSH.

Blackdagger stands out due to its comprehensive features aimed at simplifying and enhancing automation workflow management.
