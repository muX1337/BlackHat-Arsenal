# Extensible Azure Security Tool

## Description
Extensible Azure Security Tool (Later referred to as E.A.S.T) is a tool for assessing Azure and to some extent Azure AD security controls. The primary use case of EAST is Security data collection for evaluation in Azure Assessments. This information (JSON content) can then be used in various reporting tools, which we use to further correlate and investigate the data.
