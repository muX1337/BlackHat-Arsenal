# BinderAPI Scanner & BASS

## Description
BASS-Environment Synopsis
Binderlabs API Security Simulator (BASS-Env) is an intentionally vulnerable API environment tailored to reflect the OWASP Top 10 API Security Risks of 2023. Its primary goal is to function as a practical training platform for cybersecurity professionals seeking to enhance their API hacking skills and deepen their understanding of API security testing. BASS-Env provides a hands-on experience by allowing users to interact directly with flawed APIs, highlighting the significance of API security within software development.
The OpenAPI 3 Specifications and Postman Collections serve as the main interface, providing comprehensive documentation and enabling direct testing of API endpoints. At the core of BASS-Env lies its Laravel Backend/API Layer and MySQL Database, intentionally incorporating vulnerabilities across a variety of API endpoints. These components collaborate to simulate real-world scenarios, exposing vulnerabilities such as broken authentication, misconfigurations, and improper inventory management.
Moreover, BASS-Env offers laboratory-based scenarios and challenges for participants, integrating manual and scanner testing methods. Scoring mechanisms, feedback loops, hints, and tutorials assist users in comprehending and resolving challenges. The environment prioritizes security and privacy considerations, accessible locally and supported through GitHub for community engagement. Future enhancements aim to broaden the spectrum of API flaws and facilitate effective updates for BASS-Env instances.

BASS-Scanner Synopsis
