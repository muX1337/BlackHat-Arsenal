# CWE_Checker: Architecture-Independent Binary Vulnerability Analysis

## Description
Assessing the security of programs running on embedded devices is a difficult task. Source code is generally unavailable and both static and dynamic binary analysis tools often do not offer support for the many different hardware configurations found in embedded devices.

The cwe_checker is an open-source tool for finding bugs and vulnerabilities in binary executables without requiring source code access or any knowledge about the hardware. By using static analysis techniques built atop Ghidra P-Code it supports a wide range of CPU architectures including x86, ARM, MIPS and PowerPC. While its focus is the analysis of ELF binaries commonly found in Linux-based firmware, there exists experimental support for PE files and even bare-metal binaries.

The cwe_checker offers detection of over 16 different bug classes including Buffer Overflows (CWE-119), Use-After-Frees (CWE-416) and Null Dereferences (CWE-476). The tool is built in a modular fashion where each analysis can use its own bug detection technique ranging from simple heuristics to complex data flow analysis. Furthermore, each analysis has a set of configuration parameters that can be modified to adjust the analysis to specific usage scenarios. For example, you can add your own functions to the "Use of potentially dangerous function" check (CWE-676).

It is easy to integrate the cwe_checker into other tools and workflows using the alternative JSON output. For example, as a plugin into the Firmware Analysis and Comparison Tool (FACT) you can use it to hunt for vulnerabilities in large firmware data sets.
