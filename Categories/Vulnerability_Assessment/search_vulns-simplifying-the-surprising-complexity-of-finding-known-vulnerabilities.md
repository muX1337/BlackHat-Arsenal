# search_vulns: Simplifying the Surprising Complexity of Finding Known Vulnerabilities

## Description
The use of third-party software in organizations has increased dramatically in recent years. Meanwhile, new vulnerabilities are published daily. Thus, it is crucial to continuously monitor the security of third-party software. This requires efficient and precise tools to match specific software versions against known vulnerabilities.

To determine a tool to utilize in pentests, we evaluated six tools for retrieving known vulnerabilities: nvdtools, cve-search, CVE Quick Search, Snyk-DB, VulDB and Rapid7-DB.

Surprisingly, we found all to be lacking in some way, identifying mainly three types of problems: tool precision and recall, input restrictions and the lack of exporting functionalities. First, they returned inaccurate results or utilized only one source of information, e.g., lacking information about exploits. Second, they usually require users to adhere to a certain input format like CPEs. This makes them difficult and error-prone to use. Third, meaningfully exporting results was generally not possible.

To address these limitations, we developed search_vulns, which uses text comparison techniques and CPEs in combination to return high-quality results, while not imposing any input restrictions. Moreover, it returns consistent results despite product rebranding and can automatically generate CPEs that have yet to be published. Together with its custom logic for version comparison, this further enhances the quality of search_vulns' results. As it utilizes multiple data sources, unlike most other tools, its results include information about known exploits, backpatches and software recency. Finally, search_vulns provides a fine-granular export of results in different formats.

In conclusion, search_vulns represents a significant improvement over existing tools and benefits various kinds of security analysts in finding known vulnerabilities given only a software name and version. A public web application is available for typical users, while its CLI can be utilized in automated offline workflows. Thus, it has numerous applications in pentests, audits, vulnerability scanners, CI/CD pipelines, SAST or SBOM-analysis.
