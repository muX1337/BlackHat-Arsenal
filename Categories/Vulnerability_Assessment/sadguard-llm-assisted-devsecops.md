# SadGuard: LLM-Assisted DevSecOps

## Description
SadGuard was inspired by the rising threat of supply chain attacks, leveraging advanced AI to secure software pipelines against malicious contributions in pull requests. It uses intelligent code diff analysis, sandboxed executable behaviour monitoring, and entropy scanning of binaries to detect and mitigate malicious patterns before deployment.
Designed as a self-hosted tool, SadGuard provides proactive defense by embedding itself into the CI/CD process. It intelligently identifies vulnerabilities, flags obfuscation, and monitors suspicious runtime behavior. The modular architecture allows for future expansion, including support for additional LLMs and scoring systems for prioritized response.
SadGuard supports integration with GitHub via webhooks and offers seamless local deployment for complete data control. It combines intelligent detection with runtime observation to secure software pipelines while maintaining operational privacy. Built with a focus on detecting and preventing supply chain compromises, it helps harden software repositories against modern threats.
