# MI-X (Am I Exploitable?).

## Description
‘Am I Exploitable?’, is an open source tool aimed at effectively determining whether a local host or a running container image is truly vulnerable to a specific vulnerability by accounting for all factors which affect *actual* exploitability. The tool prints the logical steps it takes in order to reach a decision and can generate a flow chart depicting the complete logical flow.

The first critical step to address any security vulnerability is to verify whether or not your environment is affected. Even if a vulnerable package is installed on your system, this condition alone does not determine exploitability as several conditions must be in place in order for the vulnerability to be applicable (exploitable). For example, can the vulnerability only be exploited under a specific configuration or in a specific OS?.

Most conventional vulnerability scanners rely on package manager metadata in order to determine the installed components (and in which versions) and then cross reference this data with vulnerability advisories in order to determine what vulnerabilities affect the system. The problem with that is that often software may be deployed without a package manager. For example, software might be built from source and then added to an image or unzipped from a tarball to a specific location on the file system. In these cases, no package manager data is associated with the application, which can result in false negatives (a scanner will “miss” these vulnerabilities) and offer a false sense of security.

We aim to build a community of researchers that can improve the validation process of historically dangerous vulnerabilities, as well as newly discovered ones, so users and organizations will understand whether they are vulnerable or not, as well as which validation flow is used to reach that verdict, and what steps are necessary for remediation or mitigation.
