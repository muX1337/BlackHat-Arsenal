# Pentest Copilot: Cursor for Pentesters

## Description
Pentest Copilot is an open-source, AI-powered platform built to revolutionize penetration testing. Designed by bug bounty hunters, it seamlessly integrates a browser-based AI assistant with an interactive testing environment(optionally backed by a Kali Linux container). By enabling real-time command execution, context-aware automation, and dynamic checklists, Pentest Copilot creates a unified ecosystem where AI offsec automation and manual expertise work in tandem. Infosec pros can efficiently discover and exploit vulnerabilities without context-switching, ensuring precision, scalability, and efficiency in every engagement(bug bounty, professional or otherwise)

Previously a commercial tool, Pentest Copilot is now being open-sourced for the first time. The platform's agentic AI architecture leverages contextual reasoning, recursive automation loops, and adaptive decision-making to refine pentesting strategies dynamically. By preserving engagement context, optimizing tool execution, and intelligently summarizing findings, the AI enhances workflow efficiency without compromising control. We first introduced Pentest Copilot's architecture at Microsoft BlueHat and a whitepaper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09493), and now, we intend to launch it as an open-source project at BlackHat Arsenal
