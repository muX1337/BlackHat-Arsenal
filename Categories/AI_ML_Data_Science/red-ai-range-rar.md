# Red AI Range (RAR)

## Description
Red AI Range (RAR) is a comprehensive security platform designed specifically for AI red teaming and vulnerability assessment. It creates realistic environments where security professionals can systematically discover, analyze, and mitigate AI vulnerabilities through controlled testing scenarios.

As organizations increasingly integrate AI systems into critical infrastructure, the need for robust security testing has become essential. RAR addresses this need by providing a standardized framework that consolidates various AI vulnerabilities in one accessible environment for both academic research and industrial security operations.

Red AI Range enables security professionals to systematically assess and exploit vulnerabilities within AI systems through realistic, controlled attack scenarios. The platform's advanced Docker-based architecture resolves complex dependency issues inherent in AI frameworks, providing isolation, rapid environment resets, parallel testing capabilities, and simplified deployments. An intuitive management system streamlines deployment of vulnerable AI systems and security toolkits, offering straightforward controls via a user-friendly interface.

With remote agent support, teams can securely leverage distributed resources such as GPU-equipped clusters, coordinate across multiple locations, and manage testing scenarios from a centralized interface. Built-in session recording ensures comprehensive documentation, facilitates knowledge transfer, and supports stakeholder demonstrations. Suitable for corporate security teams, researchers, and educators, RedAiRange is ideal for vulnerability validation, exploration of emerging AI threats, practical skill development, and reproducible security research.
