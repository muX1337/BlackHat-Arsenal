# Promptfoo

## Description
Promptfoo is an offensive security tool designed to test applications built on large language models (LLMs). Leveraging the latest adversarial ML research, Promptfoo uses fine-tuned models to generate unique, application-specific payloads to exploit 60+ Gen AI vulnerability types. More than 80,000 developers use Promptfoo, including at major companies like Shopify, OpenAI, Anthropic, and Twilio.

Promptfoo is unique in its capabilities because it uses specialized adversarial agents trained to probe specific risks in AI applications. Rather than relying on generic jailbreaks or known exploits, these agents analyze your application's unique attack surface - its specific use cases, integrated tools, data sources, and security boundaries. Promptfoo then generates targeted probes to identify vulnerabilities in your applications.

The tests cover application-level categories such as PII/data leaks, access control issues via agentic tool use, as well as model-level risks like jailbreaks/injections and other harmful outputs.

Key capabilities include:

1. Conversational and multi-modal testing: Finds issues that common guardrails are unable to detect.

2. Web UI: Tracks scans and aggregates changes to risk level over time.

3. Flexible deployment: Run locally/on-premises..

4. CI/CD: Integrates with continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines.
