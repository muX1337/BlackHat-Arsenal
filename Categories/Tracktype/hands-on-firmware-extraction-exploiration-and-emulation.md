# Hands-on Firmware Extraction, Exploiration, and Emulation

## Description
Join us for this hands-on demo of Unblob, the flexible firmware extractor. In this Arsenal lab session, we will extract firmware from an EV charger, dig into the firmware, and eventually emulate it so we can interact with the services in real-time. Unblob works on both hardware and downloadable versions of firmware so we have a target rich environment. No prior experience needed, this session is appropriate for all skillsets and we are looking forward to see you there.
