# BLE CTF - A Bluetooth Low Energy Security Research Platform

## Description
BLE CTF is a series of Bluetooth Low Energy challenges in a capture the flag format. It was created to teach the fundamentals of interacting with and hacking Bluetooth Low Energy services. Each exercise, or flag, aims to interactively introduce a new concept to the user.

Over the past few years, BLE CTF has expanded to support multiple platforms and skill levels. Various books, workshops, trainings, and conferences have utilized it as an educational platform and CTF. As an open source, low cost of entry, and expandable education solution, BLE CTF has helped progress Bluetooth security research.

This demo will showcase the BLE CTF platform and its new variants. This will be the first public release of the CTF's newly supported hardware and companion firmware. Along with firmware for newly supported devices, a new expansion for the modular BLE CTF Infinity will be exhibited.
