# Pcapinator: Rise of the PCAP Machines

## Description
Pcapinator is a powerful and versatile network analysis tool that combines the strengths of TShark and Python to provide comprehensive and efficient packet deconstruction into a format usable for further analysis. Inspired by the Terminator, Pcapinator is designed to relentlessly analyze, decode, and filter network packets using all of the resources a system makes available to it, making it a formidable asset for diving deep into PCAPs.

Leveraging the robust capabilities of Wireshark's TShark tool, Pcapinator parses and extracts vital information from pcap files, while Python's extensive libraries and scripts offer advanced processing and automation options. Pcapinator is built to handle extremely large PCAP files, search for anomalies in those files, and uncover the hard-to-find information in network traffic, making it an essential tool for PCAP analysis.
