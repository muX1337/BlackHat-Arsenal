# CQData: Data Extraction & Forensic Toolkit

## Description
CQData Toolkit enables you to perform extraction of data that can be extremely useful during the investigation and incident. One of the most important things to learn during the incident is to learn the identity connected with the attack and also become familiar with hacker's actions through the detailed process tracking. CQData can extract information from the Automatic Destinations, generate a timeline, convert Automatic Destination into useful lists of processes, recover files, extract information from the configuration, calculate the vector of the attack based on the process related information and search across other affected computers, decode encrypted users' data, find encrypted data on the computer and display its characteristic, search for confirmation that logs were not manipulated with etc. It is a toolkit that authors use during the incident investigation. Toolkit was created with one purpose, to address the gaps in the evidence analysis and data collection tools. CQData also leverages the reverse engineering research done in the DPAPI area and our recent 1-year research in the Automatic Destinations area.
