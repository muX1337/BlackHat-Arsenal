# Traceeshark - Interactive System Tracing & Runtime Security using eBPF

## Description
Traceeshark brings the world of Linux runtime security monitoring and advanced system tracing to the familiar and ubiquitous network analysis tool Wireshark.

It is now possible, using Wireshark, to record an immense variety of system events using Aqua Security's eBPF based runtime security tool Tracee, and analyze them interactively.

Tracee is a runtime security and forensics tool for Linux, utilizing eBPF technology to trace systems and applications at runtime, analyze collected events to detect suspicious behavioral patterns, and capture forensics artifacts. Up until now, a typical workflow using Tracee involved running Tracee from the CLI, perform some activity, stop Tracee, dump its logs to a file, and analyze the file using command line tools or scripting languages. Analyzing packets captured by Tracee was done separately, and in general the entire process was very manual.

Now, events generated by Tracee can be analyzed interactively using Wireshark's advanced capabilities, which include interactive filtering, displaying statistics and performing advanced data aggregations. Traceeshark also provides the ability to capture events using Tracee directly from Wireshark and have them stream in like a network capture. Another game-changing feature is the ability to analyze system events side by side with network packets generated by Tracee that contain rich context about the system process and container they belong to.

The combination of Tracee's wide use in the security industry and its advanced system tracing and forensic capabilities, together with Wireshark's universal popularity in the entire IT industry, its maturity and ease of use, opens up a whole new world of capabilities for dynamic malware analysis, forensics, kernel hacking and more.
