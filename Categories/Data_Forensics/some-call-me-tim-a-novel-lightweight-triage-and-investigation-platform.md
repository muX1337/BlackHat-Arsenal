# Some Call Me TIM: A Novel, Lightweight Triage and Investigation Platform

## Description
SOC anaylsts, threat hunters, and detection engineers have the same core challenge: how can I triage and/or investigate suspicious activity, at scale, while ensuring that all of the work I do goes back into the system to improve future outcomes? TIM is a novel, lightweight triage and investigation platform that enables analysts of all types - SOC, TI, etc. - to quickly pivot and curate relevant events across any kind of data source in comfortable, unintrusive interface. Powered by AGGrid, TIM gives analysts the ability to own their workflows and open up avenues to collaboration that don't exist in the market today.
