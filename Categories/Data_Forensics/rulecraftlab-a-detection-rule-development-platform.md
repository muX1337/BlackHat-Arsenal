# RuleCraftLab - A Detection Rule Development Platform

## Description
"RuleCraftLab" is an open-source platform that provides SOC engineers, security researchers, and detection engineers with a robust environment for developing and testing detection content using real threat logs from actual systems. As the landscape of threats continues to evolve and diversify, there is a growing need for accurate and effective rules to detect and mitigate these threats. However, traditional rule development methods often lack real-world context, relying on blog posts or public rules without thorough testing. "RuleCraftLab" addresses these challenges by offering a dedicated playground where users can develop and test their rules in a realistic environment to streamline the rule development process.
