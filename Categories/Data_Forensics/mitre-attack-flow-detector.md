# MITRE ATTACK FLOW Detector

## Description
Converting all kinds of SOC alerts to mitre attack techniques and then finding those few alerts that form a mitre attack flow, seems like a lot of manual work.

But using a Large Language Model, Knowledge Graph, Temporal Graph Embedding, Density Clustering, and a Markov Model, its now possible to do it automatically in real time.
