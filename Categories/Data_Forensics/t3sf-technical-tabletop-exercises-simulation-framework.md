# T3SF (Technical TableTop Exercises Simulation Framework)

## Description
T3SF is a framework that offers a modular structure for the orchestration of events from a master scenario events list (MSEL) together with a set of rules defined for each exercise and a configuration that allows defining the parameters of the correspondent platform. The main module performs the communication with the specific module (Discord, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, Teams, etc.) which allows the events to be presented in the input channels as injects for each platform. Also, the framework supports different use cases: single organization-multiple areas, multiple organization-single area, and multiple organization-multiple areas. It has been successfully tested in exercises with international companies, which allowed us to validate its commercial level.

Tabletop exercises have 2 approaches: traditional (scenarios with discussion) and modern (automatic events on a platform). The 1st platform was funded by the DHS (USA) with USD20 MM over 10 years. In 2021 we proposed a novel approach using free platforms, which allowed the development of a free and open source framework.

The original research paper presented and published at the IEEE ARGENCON 2022 academic congress, under the title "Cybersecurity Incident Response Simulation for Organizational and Classroom Learning." Preprint available at IEEE TechRxiv: https://www.techrxiv.org/articles/preprint/Cybersecurity_incident_response_tabletop_simulations_for_learning_in_classrooms_and_organizations/20317416/1/files/36346944.pdf

The tool itself was first presented an released in the most important cybersecurity conference in Spain in (RootedCon 2022) and then updated and presented in the most important cybersecurity conference in Latin America (Ekoparty 2022).

This version is a major update, that includes a code rewrite, GUI frontend, new features, and an automatic inject creation engine (sentences in Spanish and English).
