# elfspirit: A Static Analysis and Injection Framework for ELF Files

## Description
ELFSPIRIT is a comprehensive static analysis and injection framework designed to parse, manipulate, patch, and camouflage ELF files. With elfspirit, you can explore the intricacies of the ELF format and have the freedom to finely manipulate every byte within the ELF file. elfspirt distinguishes itself by offering not only enhanced flexibility in editing but also a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) editing perspective and unique features.

elfspirit was initially just a simple injection tool. As I delved deeper into understanding Linux binary files, I came up with many novel ideas and decided to implement them through this project. Today, elfspirit boasts numerous features â€“ it's like a mixed bag of tricks. You might love some of its handy little functions, or you might dislike some of its bugs. Regardless, I hope you'll enjoy this tool.
