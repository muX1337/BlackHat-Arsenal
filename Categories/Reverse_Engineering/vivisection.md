# VivisectION

## Description
Reverse Engineering and Binary Vulnerability Research can be difficult, daunting, exhausting task, making your eyes bleed.

VivisectION leverages the power of the Vivisect Binary Analysis framework to provide Easy-Buttons for numerous Reversing difficulties, empowering reverse-engineers to achieve greater results, and reducing brain-drain in the process.

VivisectION's core value is based on interactive partial-emulation.  Imagine reversing a particularly annoying set of functions deep in the belly of an annoying compiled binary.  You may find yourself thinking "Man, I wish I had this thing in a debugger."  VivisectION's Partial-Emulation capabilities make your wish come true.

Want to strap in an analysis modules and emulate through code?  Easy.

Reconstitute Structures and C++ Classes?  let's not get crazy!

Come and see....
