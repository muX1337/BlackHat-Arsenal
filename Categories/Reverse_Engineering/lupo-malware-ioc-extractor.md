# Lupo: Malware IOC Extractor

## Description
Debugging module for Malware Analysis Automation.

I wrote Lupo mainly to automate and accelerate the process as much as possible. Lupo is a dynamic analysis tool that can be used as a module with the debugger (WinDBG).

The way the tool works is pretty straightforward. You load Lupo into the debugger and then execute it. It runs through the malware and collects predefined IOC and writes them to a text file on the disk. You can then use this information to contain and neutralize malware campaigns or simply respond to the security incident that you are working on.
