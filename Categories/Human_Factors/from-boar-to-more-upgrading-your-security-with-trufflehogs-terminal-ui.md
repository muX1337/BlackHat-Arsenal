# From Boar to More: Upgrading Your Security with Trufflehog's Terminal UI

## Description
Trufflehog is an open-source tool that helps organizations detect sensitive data leaks across their software development life cycle. It identifies text with potentially sensitive information and verifies if they are actually secret keys or passwords, reducing false-positive noise that often leads to alert fatigue.

Previously Trufflehog required command-line interface expertise and familiarity, which could be challenging to non-technical users. A new feature was recently added to provide a terminal user interface (TUI), enhancing accessibility for individuals with varying levels of technical expertise. Easy-to-use tooling contributes to a collaborative security culture that ultimately empowers individuals to engage in and improve their organization's security posture. Trufflehog's TUI enables anyone, regardless of technical skills, to scan for secrets across their organization and be a hero.
