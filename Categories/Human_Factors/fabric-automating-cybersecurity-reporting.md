# Fabric: automating cybersecurity reporting

## Description
Fabric is an open-source CLI tool and a configuration language for automating cybersecurity reporting. Taking inspiration from Terraform, we built a reporting-as-code DevSecOps tool that automates data collation and content rendering. By automating operational reporting, Fabric saves security teams time, formalizes communications, and improves stakeholder management.
