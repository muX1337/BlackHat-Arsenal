# Amini Project

## Description
The AirTag IoT device is a tracking tool developed by Apple and designed to help people find misplaced objects. However, even when Apple states that AirTag technology is solely used for tracking items, a growing number of malicious individuals are taking advantage for the simplicity to install it and set up to track unaware targets, in other words, people.

Amini is a specialized open-source hardware project to scan, detect, spoof, and play a sound for AirTag devices. This project is part of "Spy-wear: Misuse of Apple AirTags" research where we analyzed a privacy concern about AirTag misuse for tracking capabilities. It was designed to be implemented with Arduino environment, for flexible designs, and to be used in any Arduino-supported devices with BLE capabilities.
