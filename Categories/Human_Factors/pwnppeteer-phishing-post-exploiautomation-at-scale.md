# Pwnppeteer - Phishing Post {Exploi/Automa}tion at Scale

## Description
Phishing is well know attack but more and more company have implemented countermeasure to limit the efficiency of this kind of attack. For example, Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is being adopted to make password spraying and standard phishing ineffective. Countermeasures adopted raise the exploitation bar, for attacker.

But what happens if you can easily tamper MFA too? If you can proxy all traffic, directly steal sessions and automate malicious actions before the credentials are changed or the attack detected? What do you think if you phish an SSO portal and then you're able to instrument all applications granted with a SSO token...

The goal is to share my experience of a massive phishing campaign, how you can use Muraena/Necrobrowser at scale and show how we can phish and get a temporary access to steal enough data or add some persistents access in order to come back later. And of course before being detected and losing access.
