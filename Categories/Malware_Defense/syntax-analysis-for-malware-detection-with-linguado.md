# Syntax analysis for malware detection with Linguado

## Description
Linguado is a tool that measures how similar are two or more abstract syntax trees generated from various source codes. To achieve this, the program follows these steps:

1. With the library ANTLR4, the program generates the abstract syntax tree of each source code.

2. With the abstract syntax trees, it generates a graph which we can work with.

3. Once we have the graphs, it calculates the Weisfeiler-Lehman matrix.

4. From the Weisfeiler-Lehman matrix the program calculates the mean and the standard deviation. The mean and the standard deviation are the measures that we use to know how similar the abstract syntax trees are.
