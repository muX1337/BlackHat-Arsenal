# SubParse - Malware Artifact and Correlation Framework

## Description
SubParse is a modular framework designed for the automation of malware analysis using static and dynamic analysis, external threat intelligence sources and historical data/event correlation. The novelty of this approach comes in the correlation of extracted data to not only assist in identification of current samples, but also in correlating any facet of information with other samples stored within the framework. Data will be accessible through an intuitive web-based user interface which offers a comprehensive filter syntax sub-system.

Static file identification and parsing is the entry point into the framework. Currently, the scope of the framework is to support Windows-based portable executable (PE) files and Linux executables (ELF). However, the modularity of the framework allows for the easy integration of additional file parsers through plugins. Static file characteristics can be extracted using file format parsing, such as: file hashes, compile time, version information, code entry address, and section information. Across a larger sample set these attributes can offer unique views into threat actor operations and allow for the correlation of previously uncorrelated samples.

Analysis can be further enriched using enricher plugins. After completion of the static file parsing, the framework looks for any enabled enrichers. Enrichers provide an open-ended opportunity to gather additional data about the sample and add it to the framework. For example, an enricher that utilizes services provided by Abuse.ch can provide additional insight into malware behavior.

Another key enricher provides dynamic analysis. The framework will orchestrate dynamic analysis using a CAPEv2 sandbox. Dynamic analysis will provide behavioral insights into the malware, such as process activity, memory allocations and network activity. These results will be exported from CAPE and correlated with the sample within SubParse. For these artifacts, they will be submitted to the framework for full analysis and correlated to the original sample.
