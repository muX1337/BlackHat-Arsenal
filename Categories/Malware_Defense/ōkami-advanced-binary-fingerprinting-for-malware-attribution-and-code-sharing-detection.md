# ÅŒkami: Advanced Binary Fingerprinting for Malware Attribution and Code Sharing Detection

## Description
Okami is a cutting-edge tool designed to enhance malware research and cybersecurity analysis. The core functionality of Okami lies in its ability to export and individually hash all subroutines within a binary. These hashes serve as a unique fingerprint, enabling a comprehensive comparison against a database of known binaries.  It empowers researchers to meticulously use disassembled code to build a database of malicious files and then use the tool to compare new samples against that database for attribution. Okami works with renowned frameworks like Capstone and Ghidra. The tool will be released at BlackHat 2024, USA and will be fully open-sourced with the entire codebase available on GitHub.
