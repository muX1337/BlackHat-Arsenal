# Noriben: Quick and Easy Automated Malware Analysis Sandbox

## Description
Noriben is a Python-based tool that works Sysinternals Procmon to automatically collect, analyze, and report on runtime indicators of malware. It allows for the collection and analysis of unusual behavior on a system while attacks are being performed. The use of Noriben allows for manual analysis of malware while collecting its behavior, such as the use of command line arguments or manual debugging. With a host-based component, it can even run and collect info from thousands of malware samples automatically.
