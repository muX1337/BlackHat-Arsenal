# Sandbox Scryer

## Description
"Sandbox Scryer: An open source tool leveraging free sandbox technologies to enable threat hunting and intelligence"

When defending against APTs or Advanced Persistent Threats, persistent is the most important aspect of that definition. Often a security solution will stop a threat actor on initial access, when they inject command and control beacons into processes, or when they move laterally. Which leads to important questions. What's next? Will the actor try again? What are they after? How do I improve my defenses when the threat actor inevitably tries again?

A defender must be able to answer these questions. SoC analyst time is among the most valuable in any organization, and automated research tools such as sandboxes can be a valuable solution to accelerate this process. Unfortunately, making sense of all the data takes time. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are invaluable for communicating actionable intelligence about attacks, as is identifying relevant secondary payloads and top ATT&CK tactics and techniques among all the data a sandbox can generate. This critical information can be used to drive threat hunting, assessment of attack success and penetration, and pre-emptive identification of risk of future attack.

In this demonstration, we will showcase an open source tool, the Sandbox Scryer, which performs sample submission to the free Hybrid Analysis Sandbox, retrieval of results of the Sandbox's automated analysis, and extraction from these sets of important IOCs and techniques matched against MITRE Att&ck. This open source tool will be made available, which enables an organization to adapt it to their favorite free or paid sandbox (of which there are many), along with expanding it to produce of types of IOCs.
