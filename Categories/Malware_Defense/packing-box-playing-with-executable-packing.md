# Packing-Box: Playing with Executable Packing

## Description
This Docker image is an experimental toolkit gathering detectors, packers, tools and machine learning mechanics for making datasets of packed executables and training machine learning models for the static detection of packing. It aims to support PE, ELF and Mach-O executables and to study the best static features that can be used in learning-based static detectors.
