# YAMA: Yet Another Memory Analyzer for Malware Detection

## Description
YAMA is a system for generating tools that can inspect whether specific malware is present in memory during incident response. While numerous security countermeasure products exist for malware detection, targeted attacks utilizing malware that operates only in memory remain challenging to detect using existing products and continue to pose a threat.
Looking at existing open-source software (OSS) projects, some, such as PeSieve and Moneta, perform memory scans on live memory. However, few offer detection methods specifically tailored to particular malware for live systems. As file-less malware threats increase, having the means to verify the presence of malware in memory across multiple endpoints becomes crucial in incident response.
Using our proposed YAMA system, the scanner generated can create memory scanners tailored explicitly to any malware. The scanner generated by YAMA is a standalone executable capable of running on most 64-bit Windows OS. When infection investigation of malware present only in memory is required during incident response, executing the scanner created by YAMA on the suspected device will easily detect whether it is infected. Furthermore, in cases where a large-scale infection is suspected, the scanner can be distributed via Active Directory (AD) to clarify the infection status within the network.
YAMA is expected to be a powerful support tool for enhancing the investigative capabilities of Blue Teams, who conduct incident response daily
