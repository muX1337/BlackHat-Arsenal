# defender2yara: Translating Microsoft Defender Antivirus Signatures into YARA Rules

## Description
Defender2yara is a Python-based utility that converts Microsoft Defender Antivirus Signatures (VDM) into YARA rules. This tool addresses the limitations of black-box signatures, which often lack the context information of the detection essential for researchers. The YARA rules generated by this tool provide information on how Microsoft Defender detects threats, which statical features are focused on for the detection and the context of the threat classification. Defender2yara enables security professionals to create YARA rules from the latest or manually provided Microsoft Defender's signature database by bridging the gap between Microsoft's proprietary signature formats and the widely adopted human-readable YARA rule.

Key features of defender2yara include the ability to translate strings and hex byte patterns, integrate threat-scoring logic into YARA conditions, and download the latest signature databases. The tool supports exporting YARA rules into a single file or files organized by malware family, optimizing scanning efficiency with some techniques such as file header checks. Users can also specify paths for database files, ensuring flexibility in various environments.

The presentation will discuss the motivation behind defender2yara, focusing on the challenges of black-box signatures and the need for customizable detection mechanisms. It will provide an overview of Microsoft Defender's signature database structure, detailing VDM file components like strings, hex byte patterns, and threat-scoring logic.

Additionally, the architecture of defender2yara will be explored, with a high-level overview and detailed breakdown of the modules, including signature parsing and YARA rule generation. Example usage scenarios will be showcased for Blue Teams, emphasizing threat-hunting by customizing detection rules. This involves using defender2yara to create tailored YARA rules from the latest signatures, enhancing their ability to detect specific threats.

For Red Teams, the presentation will cover analyzing YARA rules to identify detection gaps and crafting evasive techniques for penetration testing and red teaming exercises.
