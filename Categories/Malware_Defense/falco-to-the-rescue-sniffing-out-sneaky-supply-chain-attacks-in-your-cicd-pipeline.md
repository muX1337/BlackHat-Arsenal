# Falco to the Rescue: Sniffing Out Sneaky Supply Chain Attacks in Your CI/CD Pipeline!

## Description
The increasing sophistication and frequency of supply chain attacks necessitate reevaluating current security practices. This talk explains how to use Falco, a CNCF open-source runtime security tool, to detect threats and malicious behaviors inside your CI/CD pipelines.

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are essential for modern software development, enabling rapid code integration, testing, and deployment. Deep visibility inside the CI/CD pipelines is critical to ensuring that the code released into production environments is secure and trustworthy. SolarWinds, CodeCov, and the recent xz-utils supply chain attacks could all have been detected by shifting further left well-known runtime security practices, starting by observing the behavior of the build and deploy servers.

With its exceptional visibility into Linux kernel system calls, Falco can be seamlessly integrated into CI/CD workflows to monitor the CI/CD server's runtime behavior. By providing valuable information on runtime events, such as malicious connections and file accesses, Falco becomes a reliable ally in detecting anomalous behavior in continuous integration pipelines.

We will walk you through real-world scenarios based on recent CI/CD threats, demoing how Falco can be used in GitHub Actions pipelines to detect malicious behaviors.
