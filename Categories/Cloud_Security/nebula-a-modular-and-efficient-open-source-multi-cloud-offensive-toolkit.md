# Nebula: a modular and efficient open-source multi-cloud offensive toolkit

## Description
Nebula is a multi-cloud offensive security testing toolkit that enables security engineers to efficiently identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations across AWS, Azure, and GCP environments. While existing cloud security tools focus on single providers or specific use cases, Nebula provides a unified framework for conducting comprehensive security assessments across multiple cloud providers and accounts simultaneously.

The framework offers specialized reconnaissance, analysis, and exploitation modules, allowing security engineers to enumerate resources across regions, detect public-facing assets, and discover exposed secrets. Its intelligent API handling and concurrent processing capabilities make it particularly effective for large-scale cloud security assessments that would be time-consuming or impractical with existing tools.

Nebula is built in Go with a modular architecture inspired by the Metasploit Framework, which emphasizes extensibility and code reuse. Security engineers can quickly develop custom modules to test new cloud services or implement novel attack techniques. The framework's composable pipeline pattern enables efficient concurrent execution of complex security assessments while abstracting away cloud API interaction and data processing challenges.

Key features include automatic multi-region enumeration, specialized scanners for public resources, integrated secret detection via Nosey Parker, and a simplified interface for cloud API interactions. Whether conducting routine security assessments or responding to incidents, Nebula provides the flexibility and performance needed for modern cloud security testing.

The toolkit has been field-tested in real-world engagements, where it has successfully identified critical attack paths including privilege escalation opportunities, exposed secrets, and publicly accessible resources that evaded detection by traditional cloud security solutions.

Key Capabilities:

1. Multi-Cloud Support: Unified interfaces for AWS, Azure, and GCP with provider-specific optimizations

2. Comprehensive Resource Enumeration: Concurrent scanning across multiple regions and resource types to provide a comprehensive summary of resources in an environment

3. Public Asset Detection: Specialized scanners for identifying publicly accessible cloud resources that create potential entry points

4. Secret Detection: Integration with Nosey Parker for identification of unprotected secrets in cloud environment

5. IAM Analysis: Advanced permission assessment to identify privilege escalation paths and excessive permissions

6. Service-Specific Security Checks: Targeted assessment modules for high-risk services (EC2, Azure VMs, S3, Azure Key Vaults, Lambda, etc.)

7. Efficient Parallel Processing: Composable pipeline pattern that automatically enables high-performance scanning

8. Extensible Output: Supports multiple output formats including JSON, Markdown tables, and console output
