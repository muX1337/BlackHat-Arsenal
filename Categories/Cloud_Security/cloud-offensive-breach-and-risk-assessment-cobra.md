# Cloud Offensive Breach and Risk Assessment (COBRA)

## Description
Cloud Offensive Breach and Risk Assessment (COBRA) is an open-source tool designed to empower users to simulate attacks within multi-cloud environments, providing a comprehensive evaluation of security controls. COBRA automates the testing of various threat vectors, including external and insider threats, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, helping organizations identify security posture weaknesses.

With our latest enhancements, COBRA now extends its capabilities to on-premise attack simulations, enabling organizations to assess hybrid cloud security risks. The tool supports lateral movement from cloud to on-prem, allowing security teams to test cross-environment attack scenarios. Additionally, COBRA introduces EDR evasion and pivoting techniques, helping organizations evaluate their endpoint detection and response effectiveness. These new features further strengthen COBRA's ability to assess an organization's detection and response capabilities across cloud and on-prem infrastructures.
