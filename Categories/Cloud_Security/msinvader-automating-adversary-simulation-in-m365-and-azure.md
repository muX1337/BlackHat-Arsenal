# msInvader: Automating Adversary Simulation in M365 and Azure

## Description
msInvader is an adversary simulation tool built for blue teams, designed to simulate adversary techniques within M365 and Azure environments. This tool generates attack telemetry, aiding teams in building, testing, and enhancing detection analytics. By implementing multiple authentication mechanisms, including OAuth flows for compromised user scenarios and service principals, msInvader mirrors realistic attack conditions. It interacts with Exchange Online using the Graph API, EWS, and REST API, providing comprehensive simulation capabilities. This session will explore msInvader's technical features, demonstrating its application in improving security defenses through detailed adversary simulations.
