# OAuthSeeker: Weaponizing OAuth Phishing for Red Team Simulations

## Description
OAuthSeeker is a cutting-edge red team tool designed to simulate OAuth phishing attacks, specifically targeting Microsoft Azure and Office365 users. This tool facilitates the creation, management, and execution of phishing campaigns without requiring advanced technical skills. By leveraging malicious OAuth applications, OAuthSeeker allows offensive security engineers to perform targeted phishing attacks to compromise user identities and gain access to Microsoft Graph API and Azure resources. With features like an administrative control panel, token refresh capabilities, and customizable skins for user-facing components, OAuthSeeker provides an effective solution for testing security defenses against a common but often overlooked attack vector.

The tool is very easy to deploy with only a single pre-compiled Go binary with zero-external dependencies and includes built-in support for LetsEncrypt. The documentation is highly detailed and outlines all the possible attack paths where this capability could be used during real-world red team engagements. The installation process is incredibly streamlined requiring only a single command to deploy a new instance of the application.
