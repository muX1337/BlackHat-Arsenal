# BadZure: Simulating and Exploring Entra ID Attack Paths

## Description
BadZure is an open-source PowerShell tool designed for Entra ID (previously known as Azure AD) security analysis. It automates the creation of vulnerable Entra ID tenant environments by utilizing the Microsoft Graph SDK. The tool configures users, groups, and application registrations, then introduces security misconfigurations to simulate attack paths. Aimed at security researchers and practitioners, BadZure facilitates conducting attack simulations, testing defenses, and enhancing the cybersecurity community's understanding of Entra ID attack vectors
