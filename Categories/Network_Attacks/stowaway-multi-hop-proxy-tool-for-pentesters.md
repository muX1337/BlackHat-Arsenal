# Stowaway: Multi-hop Proxy Tool for pentesters

## Description
Stowaway is a multi-level proxy tool written in the go language and designed for penetration testers and security researchers. Attackers can use Stowaway to construct their own tree network in a highly restricted intranet environment so that the attacker's external traffic can reach the core network through the layers of proxies of multiple Stowaway nodes. While breaking through network access restrictions, Stowaway can also help attackers hide their own traffic and better lurk in the intranet. In addition, attackers can also use the terminal interface and various auxiliary functions provided by Stowaway to more easily manage the entire tree network and improve the efficiency of penetration testing.
