# distribRuted - Distributed Attack Framework (Botnet as a Service)

## Description
Penetration testing tools often face limitations such as IP blocking, insufficient computing power, and time constraints. However, these challenges can be overcome by executing these tests across a distributed network of hundreds of devices. Organizing such a large-scale attack efficiently is complex, as the number of nodes increases, so does the difficulty in orchestration and management.

distribRuted provides the necessary infrastructure and orchestration for distributed attacks. This framework allows developers to easily create and execute specific distributed attacks using standard application modules. Users can develop their attack modules or utilize pre-existing ones from the community. With distribRuted, automating, managing, and tracking a distributed attack across hundreds of nodes becomes straightforward, thereby enhancing efficiency, reducing time and costs, and eliminating a Single Point of Failure (SPoF) in penetration testing.
