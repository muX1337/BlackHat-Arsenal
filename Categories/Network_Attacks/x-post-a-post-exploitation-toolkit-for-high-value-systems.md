# [X-Post] A Post Exploitation Toolkit for High Value Systems

## Description
The topic discussed the post-exploitation research on high-value systems such as email servers, gateway devices, documents, enterprise knowledge management and collaboration platforms, single sign-on platforms, defect tracking platforms, IT operations management software, domain management team building, code repository management, etc.Targeting various applications, it was achieved by deploying highly covert plugins and leveraging deprecated functionalities to hijack the runtime web container request processing logic and implant highly concealed persistent backdoors in memory. These memory-implanted backdoors serve as loaders to execute effective payloads directly in memory, with both the backdoor code logic and functional payloads operating within memory.

In-depth analysis of the code logic for different applications led to the exploration of solutions for challenges encountered during the runtime execution of payloads in memory. These challenges included multiple class loader loading, bypassing system file verification protection, and context decoupling for functional code extraction, among other issues.

The implementation enabled the execution of effective payloads in memory without initiating additional network requests to the target or writing files to disk. This allowed for the covert execution of payloads in memory under highly concealed attack scenarios, facilitating the extraction of high-value system information, such as email retrieval, plaintext password recording, operations data acquisition, obtaining arbitrary login credentials under unknown passwords, domain controller information retrieval, single sign-on hijacking, and trace cleaning operations.

Subsequently, existing web shell management tools were utilized to encrypt and transmit data, achieving traffic-side concealment. This approach aims to achieve a more comprehensive, covert, and long-term post-exploitation information gathering and deep penetration in real-world attack scenarios.
