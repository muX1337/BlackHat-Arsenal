# KubeHound: Identifying attack paths in Kubernetes clusters at scale with no hustle

## Description
There's no two ways about it: Kubernetes is a confusing and complex collection of intertwined systems. Finding attack paths in Kubernetes by hand is a frustrating, slow, and tedious process. Defending Kubernetes against those same attack paths is almost impossible without any third party tooling.

In this workshop we will present KubeHound - an opinionated, scalable, offensive-minded Kubernetes attack graph tool used by security teams across Datadog. We will cover the custom KubeHound DSL and demonstrate its power to identify some of the more interesting and common attack primitives. For the more advanced users, we will cover how to tweak our DSL to have it tailored to your own needs and find relevant attack paths that matter to you.

At last, is this workshop we will also demonstrate two way of using KubeHound:

* As a standalone tool that can be run from a laptop

* Or deployed  as a service in your own Kubernetes clusters (KubeHound as a Service)

The main goal of this workshop is to show how defenders can find and eliminate the most dangerous attack paths and how attackers can have a treasure map to fully compromise a Kubernetes cluster by using the free and open source version of KubeHound.
