# Volatility 3

## Description
Since being announced at Black Hat USA 2007, the open source Volatility Memory Analysis Framework has become the industry standard tool to perform advanced memory forensics in support of incident response, malware analysis, and digital forensics. In Spring 2025, a complete rewrite of the framework, Volatility 3, was officially released as a replacement of the previous framework version. In this Black Hat Arsenal session, attendees will learn about all the new features of the framework, including many new malware detection capabilities as well as API and feature enhancements to support large-scale, modern investigations. The session will also let attendees interact with several of the core developers of the project to facilitate discussion of desired new features and capabilities.
