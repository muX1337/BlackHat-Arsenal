# Luminaut: Casting Light on Shadow Cloud Deployments

## Description
Shadow IT and forgotten proof-of-concept environments frequently become the weak links attackers exploit—unmonitored, undocumented, and outside standard security controls. Whether it's a forgotten cloud instance left open to the internet or a testing environment quietly turned into a production system, these deployments often fly under the radar until they become part of an incident. Once discovered, accurately scoping the environment is critical to identifying existing resources, active services, and their exposure to the internet.

Our open-source tool, Luminaut, scans cloud environments to identify services exposed to the internet, providing critical context from the inside out to jumpstart your investigation. Within minutes, Luminaut will highlight exposed IP addresses and associated compute and networking resources, layering on a timeline from cloud audit logging and context from external scanners. Whether working an incident for an enterprise security team or responding to a customer's AWS or Google Cloud environment, Luminaut helps answer critical scoping questions—what is exposed, where it's running, and how long it has been there—giving investigators a head start on triage, root cause analysis, and informing stakeholders. Arsenal attendees will leave with a free, ready-to-use tool that empowers them to rapidly assess and mitigate cloud exposure in real-world investigations.
