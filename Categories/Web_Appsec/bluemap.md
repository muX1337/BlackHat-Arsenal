# BlueMap

## Description
BlueMap helps cloud red teamers and security researchers identify IAM misconfigurations, information gathering, and abuse of managed identities in interactive mode without ANY third-party dependencies. No more painful installations on the customer's environment, No more need to custom the script to avoid SIEM detection!

The tool leaves minimum traffic in the network logs so it can help during red team engagements from on-prem to the cloud. Developed in Python and implemented all Azure integrations from scratch with zero dependencies on Powershell stuff. The idea behind the tool is to allow security researchers and red team members to focus on Opsec rather than DevOps stuff.

The tool is currently in the Alpha version and with initial capabilities, but it will evolve with time.
