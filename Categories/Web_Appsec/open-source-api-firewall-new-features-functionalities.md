# Open-Source API Firewall: New Features & Functionalities

## Description
The open-source API Firewall by Wallarm is designed to protect REST and GraphQL API endpoints in cloud-native environments. API Firewall provides API hardening with the use of a positive security model allowing calls that match a predefined API specification for requests and responses while rejecting everything else.

The key features of API Firewall are:

- Secure REST and GraphQL API endpoints by blocking non-compliant requests/responses

- Stop API data breaches by blocking malformed API responses

- Discover Shadow API endpoints

- Block attempts to use request/response parameters not specified in an OpenAPI specification

- Validate JWT access tokens

- Validate other OAuth 2.0 tokens using introspection endpoints

- Denylist compromised API tokens, keys, and Cookies
