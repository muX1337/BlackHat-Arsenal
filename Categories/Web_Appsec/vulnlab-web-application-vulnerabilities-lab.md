# VulnLab Web Application Vulnerabilities Lab

## Description
VulnLab is a lab environment to learn various Web vulnerabilities and test different exploitation techniques developed with PHP and runs on Docker container. The main reason we created Vulnlab is that there are already well-known applications with similar content but these applications are getting out of date day by day. In order to solve this problem,
VulnLab will be updated by our community when a new vulnerability has been found such as spring4shell or log4j. Currently, Vulnlab only includes the OWASP TOP 10 vulnerabilities.
