# AppSecLens: AI-Driven Adaptive Application Risk Ranking

## Description
AppSecLens is an innovative web application security tool, specifically designed to assist organizations in proactively managing their attack surface, identifying vulnerabilities, and prioritizing remediation efforts with a focus on Application Risk Ranking.

Inspired by VulnHero, AppSecLens identifies related web applications using domain knowledge, conducts context-based discoveries, and employs AI-powered algorithms to assign application risk rankings. The tool evaluates web applications based on criteria such as potential business risks, presence of PII/NPI/HPI data, authentication structure, underlying technology stack, patch cadence, and security posture. AppSecLens's AI-driven algorithm assigns automatic tags and labels accordingly, enabling efficient risk prioritization.

By integrating with third-party APIs and threat intelligence databases, AppSecLens remains up-to-date with the latest vulnerabilities and exploits. The tool also supports seamless collaboration with other security tools and systems, facilitating coordinated remediation efforts. Its customizable dashboards and reporting options empower users to monitor and manage risks effectively, ensuring a more robust and secure web application environment.
