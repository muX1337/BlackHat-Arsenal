# Intro to CICDGuard - How to have visibility and security OF CICD ecosystem

## Description
CICDGuard is a graph based CICD ecosystem visualizer and security analyzer, which -

1) Represents entire CICD ecosystem in graph form, providing intuitive visibility and solving the awareness problem

2) Identifies common security flaws across supported technologies and provides industry best practices and guidelines for identified flaws adhering to OWASP CICD Top10 vulnerabilities

3) Identifies the relationship between different technologies and demonstrates how vulnerability in one component can affect one or more other technologies

Technologies supported - GitHub, GitHub Action, Jenkins, JFrog, Spinnaker, Drone

CICD platforms are an integral part of the overall software supply chain and it processes a lot of sensitive data, compromise of which can affect the entire organization. Security IN CICD is a well discussed topic, security OF CICD deserves the same attention. One of the challenges with security OF CICD, like most areas of security, is the lack of visibility of what actually makes a CICD ecosystem. Security starts with being aware of what needs to be secure.
