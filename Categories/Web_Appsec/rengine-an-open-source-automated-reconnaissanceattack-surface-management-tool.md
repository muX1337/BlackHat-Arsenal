# reNgine: An Open-Source Automated Reconnaissance/Attack Surface Management tool

## Description
reNgine is an open-source automated reconnaissance framework, that helps quickly discover the attack surface using highly customizable and powerful scan engines. reNgine also comes with some of the most innovative features such as sub scans feature, configurable scan report (both reconnaissance and vulnerability pdf report), tools arsenal which allows updating preinstalled tools and their configurations, graphical distribution of assets, WHOIS identification, and tons of actionable insights such as most common vulnerability, most common CVE IDs, etc.

The most recent versions of reNgine make it more than just a recon tool!

reNgine has always aimed to fix the gap in the traditional recon tools and is probably a much better alternative for some of the commercial recon and vulnerability assessment tools.
