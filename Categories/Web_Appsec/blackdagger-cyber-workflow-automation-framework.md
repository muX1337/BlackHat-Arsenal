# Blackdagger: Cyber Workflow Automation Framework

## Description
Blackdagger is an innovative workflow automation framework specifically designed to simplify and accelerate cybersecurity operations across DevOps, DevSecOps, MLOps, MLSecOps, and Continuous Automated Red Teaming (CART). At its core, Blackdagger reduces complexity and manual overhead by leveraging a novel declarative YAML-based Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) approach, enabling users to intuitively define automation pipelines, clearly visualize task dependencies, and minimize extensive scripting or coding typically required by traditional cronbased schedulers and orchestration platforms. A user-friendly built-in Web UI further empowers users by providing easy, real-time management, monitoring, and execution of workflows.

Blackdagger's ecosystem includes several integrated tools and workflow suites, creating a comprehensive cybersecurity automation framework:

- Blackcart: A specialized Docker container optimized for Continuous Automated Red Teaming (CART) and DevSecOps pipeline tasks.

- Blackdagger YAMLs: Pre-tested example workflows, demonstrating real-world DevSecOps and CART use-cases, facilitating quick adoption and adaptation.

- Blackdagger Github Infra: A suite of advanced workflows utilizing GitHub Actions infrastructure for enhanced defense evasion techniques, scalability, and performance.

- Blackdagger Web Kit (BWK): A browser extension integrating all core functionalities, enabling direct interaction and execution of Blackdagger workflows from within the browser.

During this Arsenal session, attendees will see practical demonstrations of Blackdagger's capabilities, including rapid deployment of DevSecOps and CART workflows, pipeline visualization, and streamlined security task automation in action.
