# HAWK Eye - PII & Secret Detection tool for your Servers, Database, Filesystems, Cloud Storage Services

## Description
HAWK Eye is a powerful Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to enhance data source security by detecting and protecting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) across various platforms. Inspired by the precision and vision of majestic birds of prey, HAWK Eye swiftly scans multiple data sources, including S3, MySQL, Redis, Firebase, filesystem, and Google Cloud Storage (GCS), for potential data breaches and cyber threats.

With data breaches becoming more prevalent, organizations need robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information. HAWK Eye provides a comprehensive solution, capable of seamlessly integrating with different data sources to identify and protect PII. Its extensible architecture allows developers to contribute new commands, empowering the tool to address evolving security needs.

Future Roadmap:
HAWK Eye is continuously evolving, and we have an exciting roadmap ahead! Our plans include adding support for more than 20+ additional data sources, such as MongoDB, Jira, and ticketing services. These integrations will enable HAWK Eye to detect PII and secrets from a diverse range of applications, ensuring comprehensive data source security for users.
