# Gerobug: The First Open-Source Bug Bounty Platform

## Description
Organizations often lack the necessary resources and diverse skills to identify hidden vulnerabilities before attackers exploit them. Bug bounty program, which incentivizes ethical hackers to report bugs, emerged to bridge the skills gap and address the imbalance between attackers and defenders.

However, integrating bug bounty program into security strategies remains challenging due to limitations in efficiency, security, budget, and the scalability of consulting-based or third-party solutions.

Gerobug is the first open-source bug bounty platform that allows organizations to establish their own bug bounty platform easily and securely, free of charge.
