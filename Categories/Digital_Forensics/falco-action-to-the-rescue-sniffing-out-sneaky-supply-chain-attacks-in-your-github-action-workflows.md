# Falco Action to the Rescue: Sniffing Out Sneaky Supply Chain Attacks in Your GitHub Action Workflows!

## Description
Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are essential in modern software development, enabling rapid code integration, testing, and deployment. Achieving deep visibility within these pipelines is critical to ensure the code released to production is secure and reliable.

Falco-action leverages Falco, an open-source runtime security tool from CNCF, to detect threats and malicious activity within CI/CD pipelines. With its exceptional visibility into Linux kernel system calls, falco-action integrates seamlessly into GitHub workflows to monitor the runtime behavior of the runner server. By capturing key runtime events, such as suspicious connections and file accesses, Falco acts as a dependable ally in identifying anomalous behavior in CI/CD environments.

We'll guide you through real-world scenarios, demonstrating how falco-action can be used in GitHub Actions pipelines to detect and address malicious behavior effectively.
