# GearGoat : Car Vulnerabilities Simulator

## Description
GearGoat is a python based implementation Car simulator, inspired from the ICSim tool (written in C), to help learners get started with car hacking. The idea is to provide an easy to use simulator with a virtual can interface, webUI interface and most dependencies handled inside a Docker container. This allows users to run this tool on a non-GUI/Qt machine with just a few clicks. Also, as it is written in Python, communities can easily extend it with their own code. The version with ICSim level functionality with webUI and Dockerised environment is already released on GitHub and currently we are working to add common/known vulnerabilities to it to act as a vulnerable target practice car.
