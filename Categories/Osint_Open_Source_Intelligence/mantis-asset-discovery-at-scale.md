# Mantis - Asset Discovery at Scale

## Description
Mantis is an asset inventory framework that has the capability to distribute a single scan across multiple machines, provides easy customization, dashboard support, and advanced alerting capabilities. We have not reinvented the wheel. Rather, we have tried to design an architecture that provides the essential features for a framework that involves the complexity of integrating multiple tools that are outside our control.
