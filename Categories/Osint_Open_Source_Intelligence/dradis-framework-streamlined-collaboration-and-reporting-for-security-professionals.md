# Dradis Framework: Streamlined Collaboration and Reporting for Security Professionals

## Description
In 2025, managing the information flow during assessments is just as important as finding vulnerabilities. Dradis Framework is an open-source communication and reporting tool for penetration testing teams designed to optimize your workflow, speed up reporting, and get rid of redundancies. Dradis combines results from scanners like Nessus, Burp Suite, and Nikto with manual findings and thorough attack narratives, facilitating smooth team-wide communication and an automated reporting process by centralising findings, notes, and evidence in a single portal.

Over the past ten years, Dradis has been battle-tested by thousands of infosec professionals, this community-driven effort has resulted in innovations like dynamic scanning tool mappings, a custom CSV importer, and new tool integrations. Learn how our most recent updates—which include in-app quality assurance workflows, easier deployment with Docker, and AI-driven enhancements—allow for the creation of reports faster and with greater quality. Come and learn how Dradis Framework works and how can it make your life a lot easier.
