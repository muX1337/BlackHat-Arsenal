# Exposor - A Contactless reconnaissance tool using internet search engines with a unified syntax

## Description
The attack surface of organizations is constantly evolving, making real-time discovery of exposed technologies and vulnerabilities critical for proactive security. However, conducting searches across multiple Search Engine requires understanding different query syntaxes, which can be time-consuming and inefficient.

Exposor is an open-source Contactless Reconnaissance tool that unifies searches across multiple intelligence feeds, allowing security professionals to identify exposed systems based on CPE (technology) or CVE (vulnerabilities) using a single, simplified query format. Instead of crafting queries for each platform separately, Exposor automatically maps queries to the correct syntax and retrieves results in parallel.
