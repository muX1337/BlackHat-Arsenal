# OSINT-Collector

## Description
This project proposes an advanced framework for integrating and unifying the management of OSINT data. Our primary objective is to develop an intuitive user interface that streamlines the collection, organization, and analysis of these data. Moreover, our tool will leverage cutting-edge algorithms and methodologies to enhance the filtering, analysis, and correlation of collected data. Specifically, our focus lies in the development of sophisticated techniques for extracting valuable insights, making informed inferences, and uncovering hidden relationships. Central to our approach is the integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), Ontologies, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Knowledge Graphs offer a structured representation of information, encapsulating entities, relationships, and their interconnectedness in a semantic graph format. Complementing this, NLP techniques empower the extraction of meaningful insights from unstructured textual data, including social media posts, news articles, and forum discussions. Additionally, ontologies play a pivotal role in imbuing unstructured data with semantic meaning, thereby contextualizing them within the pertinent domain. Through the seamless integration of these cutting-edge methodologies, our framework aims to empower users of all technical proficiencies to extract invaluable information from the vast expanse of OSINT data. Specifically, our tool facilitates OSINT investigations and aids in the identification of individuals potentially linked to criminal or terrorist activities. Through its robust capabilities, our framework stands as a powerful ally in the quest for actionable intelligence and informed decision-making.
