# Prediction System for Lateral Movement Based on ATT&CK Using Sysmon

## Description
This tool converts Windows logs collected by Sysmon into MITER ATT&CK Technique and allows us to refer to attack types and progress based on the ATT&CK structure.
In a company network, when we detect that a device has been infected with malware, it is not easy to find other infected devices, and we consume a lot of human resources and time. With this tool, we can grasp the possibility of infection to other devices and the progress of attack using ATT&CK and statistical methods based on the Sysmon log.
Furthermore, this tool automatically converts aggregated Sysmon logs into ATT&CK Technique using Atomic Red Team's library. The converted information is visualized in a list format or colored in the ATT&CK Matrix.
It is beneficial when significant and chaotic logs can be transformed into a clear cybersecurity knowledge base format in a few moments. The tool is also helpful for real-world anomaly detection and cybersecurity learning.
We will provide this tool as a Web application and publish its source code on GitHub.

Not sure if this is the tool.
