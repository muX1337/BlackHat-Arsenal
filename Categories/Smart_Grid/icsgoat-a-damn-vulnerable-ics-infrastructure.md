# ICSGoat: A Damn Vulnerable ICS Infrastructure

## Description
ICSGoat: A Damn Vulnerable ICS Infrastructure is a training tool built to emulate SCADA outstations and PLC setups, offering insights into the security threats prevalent in Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Industrial Control Systems are integral to the operation of critical infrastructures, but the increasing interconnectivity of these systems with the internet exposes them to various cybersecurity threats, necessitating effective testing tools to assess the security posture of SCADA and PLC systems. Tailored for ICS engineers, this simulated environment replicates real-world scenarios, spotlighting vulnerabilities inherent in weak architecture.

Featuring multiple insecure protocols, SCADA applications, and PLC attacks, ICSGoat serves as a dynamic platform for comprehending and mitigating potential disruptions to mission-critical systems. Through hands-on exploration within a safe, controlled environment, engineers can fortify their understanding of ICS security, enabling proactive defense measures against evolving threats.
