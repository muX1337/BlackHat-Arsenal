# PurpleSharp: Automated Adversary Simulation

## Description
Defending enterprise networks against attackers continues to present a difficult challenge for blue teams. Prevention has fallen short; improving detection & response capabilities has proven to be a step in the right direction. However, without the telemetry produced by adversary behavior, building and testing detection capabilities will be a challenging task.

PurpleSharp is an open-source adversary simulation tool written in C# that executes adversary techniques against Windows environments. The resulting telemetry can be leveraged to measure and improve the efficacy of a detection program. PurpleSharp executes different behavior across the attack lifecycle following the MITRE ATT&CK Frameworkâ€™s tactics: execution, persistence, privilege escalation, credential access, lateral movement, etc.
