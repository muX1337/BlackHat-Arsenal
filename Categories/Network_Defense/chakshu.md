## Description
Problem Statement

Network assessments, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning are critical tasks for security professionals, network administrators, and penetration testers. However, the use of multiple command-line interface (CLI) tools to carry out these tasks often leads to fragmented workflows, complexity in tool management, and inefficient scanning processes. Managing different CLI tools, interpreting results from various formats, and configuring repetitive tasks can be time-consuming and prone to error. Additionally, security experts must often manually handle tasks like scheduling scans, integrating proxy chains, managing distributed scanning, and ensuring easy export of results. As the demand for more streamlined, integrated, and automated solutions increases, there is a clear need for a unified tool that simplifies these operations while maintaining powerful features.

Tool Abstract

Network_Scan_hub  is an open-source graphical user interface (GUI) designed to bring together multiple command-line network scanning tools, such as Naabu, Nmap, RustScan, and others, into a cohesive platform. This tool enhances the user experience by offering a simple, streamlined interface for managing and executing network scans, automating repetitive tasks, and presenting results in a user-friendly format. By consolidating several key scanning functionalities into one platform, Network_Scan_hub makes it easier for security professionals to carry out comprehensive network assessments while minimizing their interaction with the command line. This tool supports a wide range of network scanning features, including vulnerability checks, scan scheduling, proxy chaining, and agent-based scanning. It is designed to simplify complex workflows, improve productivity, and make network security assessments more accessible to both experienced professionals and newcomers alike.
