# Active Directory Cyber Deception using Huginn

## Description
Huginn helps realise strategic adversary deception concepts from the MITRE Engage framework and the European Central Bank's cyber resilience report using novel techniques and an open-source program.

We demonstrate creation and monitoring of the following decoy assets during this presentation:

- Certificate Templates (ESC4 & ESC1)

- Computer Object Take-over via RBCD

- Decoy Users

- Decoy Object ACLs

- Retrieve GMSA Passwords

Our objectives are to:

- Reduce the security posture requirements for engaging in cyber deception.

- Balance the intrinsic asymmetry of cyber-attacks by raising high-fidelity alerts around advanced attacker activity.

- Impose cost by embedding high-value deception artefacts within critical attack paths.
