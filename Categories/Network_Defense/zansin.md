# ZANSIN

## Description
ZANSIN is envisioned as a GROUNDBREAKING cybersecurity training tool designed to equip users against the ever-escalating complexity of cyber threats. It achieves this by providing learners with a platform to engage in simulated cyberattack scenarios, supervised and designed by experienced pentesters. This comprehensive approach allows learners to actively apply security measures, perform system modifications, and handle incident responses to counteract the attacks. Engaging in this hands-on practice within realistic environments enhances their server security skills and provides practical experience in identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks. ZANSIN's flexible design accommodates diverse skill levels and learning styles, making it a comprehensive and evolving platform for cybersecurity education.
