# eBPFShield: Advanced IP-Intelligence & DNS Monitoring using eBPF

## Description
eBPFShield is a powerful security tool that utilizes eBPF and Python to provide real-time IP-Intelligence and DNS monitoring. By executing in kernel space, eBPFShield avoids costly context switches, making it a high-performance solution for detecting and preventing malicious behavior on your network. The tool offers efficient monitoring of outbound connections and comparison with threat intelligence feeds, making it an effective solution for identifying and mitigating potential threats. The tool includes features such as DNS monitoring, IP-Intelligence, and the ability to pull down public threat feeds.

Additionally, it includes a roadmap for future developments such as support for IPv6, automated IP reputation analysis using Machine Learning algorithms, and integration with popular SIEM systems for centralized monitoring and alerting.

eBPFShield is especially useful for companies and organizations that handle sensitive information and need to ensure the security of their networks. It's an efficient solution to monitor and protect servers from potential threats and it can help to prevent data breaches and other cyber attacks.
