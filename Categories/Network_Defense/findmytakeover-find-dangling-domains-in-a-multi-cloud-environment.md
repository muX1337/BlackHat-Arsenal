# findmytakeover - find dangling domains in a multi cloud environment

## Description
findmytakeover detects dangling DNS record in a multi cloud environment. It does this by scanning all the DNS zones and the infrastructure present within the configured cloud service provider either in a single account or multiple accounts and finding the DNS record for which the infrastructure behind it does not exist anymore rather than using wordlist or bruteforcing DNS servers.
