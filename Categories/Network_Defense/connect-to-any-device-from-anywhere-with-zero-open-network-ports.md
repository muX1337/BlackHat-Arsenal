# Connect to any device from anywhere with ZERO OPEN NETWORK PORTS

## Description
Imagine connecting to a device remotely from anywhere on the planet without having to open any network ports on either end - that translates to having ZERO NETWORK ATTACK SURFACES.

This is made possible with Atsign's open source No Ports Product suite which is build on the patented Networking 2.0 technology.
