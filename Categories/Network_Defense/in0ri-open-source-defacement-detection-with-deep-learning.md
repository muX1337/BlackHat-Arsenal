# In0ri: Open Source Defacement Detection With Deep Learning

## Description
In0ri is the first open source system for detecting defacement attacks by utilizing image-classification convolutional neural network. In this presentation, we will be demonstrating the process of setting up In0ri and have it detect defacement attacks. And optionally the process of training the machine learning model. We will also be explaining the reason behind In0ri's high accuracy when classifying defacement attacks.
