# eBPFShield: Unleashing the Power of eBPF for OS Kernel Exploitation and Security.

## Description
Are you looking for an advanced tool that can help you detect and prevent sophisticated exploits on your systems? Look  no further than eBPFShield. Let's take a technical look at some of the capabilities of this powerful technology:

DNS monitoring feature is particularly useful for detecting DNS tunneling, a technique used by attackers to bypass  network security measures. By monitoring DNS queries, eBPFShield can help detect and block these attempts before any damage is done.

IP-Intelligence feature allows you to monitor outbound connections and check them against threat intelligence lists. This  helps prevent command-and-control (C2) communications, a common tactic used by attackers to control compromised  systems. By blocking outbound connections to known C2 destinations, eBPFShield can prevent attackers from  exfiltrating sensitive data or delivering additional payloads to your system.

eBPFShield Machine Learning feature, you can develop and run advanced machine learning algorithms entirely in eBPF. We  demonstrate a flow-based network intrusion detection system(IDS) based on machine learning entirely in eBPF. Our  solution uses a decision tree and decides for each packet whether it is malicious or not, considering the entire previous  context of the network flow.

eBPFShield Forensics helps address Linux security issues by analyzing system calls and kernel events to detect possible  code injection into another process. It can also help identify malicious files and processes that may have been  introduced to your system, allowing you to remediate any security issues quickly and effectively.

During the session, we'll delve deeper into these features and demonstrate how eBPFShield can help you protect your  systems against even the most advanced threats.
