  <summary>Catching adversaries on Azure - Deception on Cloud</summary>
  Cloud is a widely adopted technology for organizations across the globe. It's very often a breeding ground for adversaries as the targets are now reachable to adversaries from anywhere in the world. More often than not, foothold into cloud is just a simple "password-spray" away. How to catch adversaries who are eyeing your crown jewels on cloud? Often adversaries are after your keys, secrets, data, emails, etc. A great way to protect is to put traps everywhere and wait for adversaries to fall into them. But deception on cloud is Hard to create, maintain, monitor, remove and most of all it's pricy. Cloud-Deception is a tool that intends to make it easier for individuals and organizations to deploy, monitor, maintain and remove deception with the most minimal price tag to it. This is done with the help of a CLI suite that creates real-like users (with known weak passwords), real-like resources (such as key vaults, storage accounts, etc.) and real-like identities (Managed identities). All these resources and identities have role assignments randomly assigned and the output is a glorious attack path that's very lucrative for an adversary to pursue. Cloud-deception enables logging automatically and creates alert rules so all you have to do relax and wait for adversaries. Cloud-deception currently supports Microsoft Azure. The talk will consist of a breath-taking tale of how to creation &amp; monitoring of deception on cloud.

  <summary>EMBA â€“ From firmware to exploit</summary>
  IoT (Internet of Things) and OT (Operational Technology) are the current buzzwords for networked devices on which our modern society is based on. In this area, the used operating systems are summarized with the term firmware. The devices themselves, also called embedded devices, are essential in the private and industrial environments as well as in the so-called critical infrastructure. 

Penetration testing of these systems is quite complex as we have to deal with different architectures, optimized operating systems and special protocols. EMBA is an open-source firmware analyzer with the goal to simplify and optimize the complex task of firmware security analysis. EMBA supports the penetration tester with the automated detection of 1-day vulnerabilities on binary level. This goes far beyond the plain CVE detection: With EMBA you always know which public exploits are available for the target firmware. Besides the detection of already known vulnerabilities, EMBA also supports the tester on the next 0-day. For this, EMBA identifies critical binary functions, protection mechanisms and services with network behavior on a binary level. There are many other features built into EMBA, such as fully automated firmware extraction, finding file system vulnerabilities, hard-coded credentials, and more.

EMBA is the open-source firmware scanner, created by penetration testers for penetration testers.

  <summary>Slips: A machine-learning based, free-software, P2P Network Intrusion Prevention System</summary>
  For the last 7 years we developed Slips, a behavioral-based intrusion prevention system, and the first free-software network IDS using machine learning. Slips profiles the behavior of IP addresses and performs detections inside each time window in order to also *unblock* IPs. Slips has more than 20 modules that detect a range of attacks both to and from the protected device. It is an network EDR with the capability to also protect small networks. 



Slips consumes multiple packets and flows, exporting data to SIEMs. More importantly, Slips is the first IDS to automatically create a local P2P network of sensors, where instances share detections following a trust model resilient to adversaries.. 



Slips works in several directionality modes. The user can choose to detect attacks coming *to* or going *from* these profiles, or both. This makes it easy to protect your network but also to focus on infected computers inside your network, which is a novel technique.



Among its modules, Slips includes the download/manage of external Threat Intelligence feed (including our laboratory's own TI feed), whois/asn/geocountry enrichment, a LSTM neural net for malicious behavior detection, port scanning detection (vertical and horizontal) on flows, long connection detection, etc. The decisions to block profiles or not are based on ensembling 

algorithms. The P2P module connects to other Slips to share detection alerts.



Slips can read packets from the network, pcap, Suricata, Zeek, Argus and Nfdump, and can output alerts files and summaries. Having Zeek as a base tool, Slips can correctly build a sorted timeline of flows combining all Zeek logs. Slips can send alerts using the STIX/TAXII protocol.



Slips web interface allows to clearly see the detections and behaviors, including threat inteligence enhancements. The interface can show multiple Slips runs, summarize whois/asn/geocountry information and much more.

  <summary>Malicious Executions: Unmasking Container Drifts and Fileless Malware with Falco</summary>
  Containers are the most popular technology for deploying modern applications. SPOILER ALERT: bypassing well-known security controls is also popular. In this talk, we explain how to use the recent updates in Falco, a CNCF open-source container security tool, to detect drifts and fileless malware in containerized environments. 



As a best practice, containers should be considered immutable. Early this year, Falco introduced new features to detect container drift via OverlayFS, which can spot if binaries are added or modified after the container's deployment. New binaries are often a sign of an ongoing attack.



Of course, attackers can also use more advanced evasion techniques to stay hidden. By using in-memory, fileless execution, attackers can bypass most of the security controls such as drift detection, and still reach their goals with no stress. 



To combat fileless attacks, Falco has also added memfd-based fileless execution thanks to its visibility superpowers on Linux kernel system calls. Combining Falco's existing runtime security capabilities with these two new detection layers forms the foundation of an in-depth defense strategy for cloud-native workloads.



We will walk you through real-world scenarios based on recent threats and malware, demoing how Falco can help detect and respond to these malicious behaviors and comparing drift and fileless attack paths.

  <summary>.NET Unpacking: When Frida Gets the JIT out of It</summary>
  .NET-based malware families (like AgentTesla, CrimsonRat, and MassLogger, to list a few) can include obfuscation or packing that would harden analysts' work to understand and mitigate these threats effectively. Several options exist for researchers to tackle this challenge such as (but not limited to ) De4Dot, JITM (Mandiant 2020), DotDumper (Black Hat 2022), or JitHook (JSAC 2023) ... However, those solutions either don't cover the case where CLR APIs are intercepted by the packer, or do it in a very limited way. Our new tool has been developed to address this issue, adding some notable advancements that hopefully will prove its utility in the field of malware analysis.

Our Frida-Jit-unPacker (FJP) tool uses a passive, less intrusive approach than previous tools, making it less likely to be detected by anti-unpacking-features. It is developed using Python3 and Frida and doesn't impose restrictions on the .NET framework version associated with the sample. The tool is not focused on specific packers, making it generic and flexible. 

One of its improvements compared to previously listed tools is its ability to also recover and fix original tokens from encrypted ones.

In addition, this tool employs several strategies to be more covert in its operations compared to existing solutions. It achieves this by focusing on intercepting lower-level functions, less likely to set off anti-unpacking mechanisms typically employed by packers. This stealthy approach is further enhanced by disassembling the Common Language Runtime (CLR) - strategically placing hooks just before or after likely monitoring points, tactically reducing the chances of triggering packers' anti-unpacking mechanisms.

These enhancements aim to assist analysts and researchers in the evolving 'cat and mouse' game of malware code protection. Hopefully, the tool will prove to be a valuable addition to the researchers' arsenal.

  <summary>PMDET, a new fuzzing-based detection tool for Android Parcel Mismatch bugs</summary>
  Android has designed Parcel as its high-performance transport to pass objects across processes.

For classes to be serialized by Parcel, developers must implement the methods for writing and reading the object's properties to and from a Parcel container. The inconsistency between those methods implemented by careless developers introduces Parcel Mismatch bugs, often occurring in vendor-customed classes due to lack of public scrutiny.

Parcel Mismatch bugs can be abused by malicious applications to gain system privilege and have been massively exploited in the wild. However, due to the nature of those bugs, it cannot be solved by traditional source-to-sink taint analysis, currently no mature solutions exist to detect Parcel Mismatch bugs.

Here we proposes PMdet, a new fuzzing-based detection tool for Parcel Mismatch bugs.

PMdet is capable of handling different vendors' firmware without actual devices. It loads Parcelable classes from Android firmware, emulates the Android runtime environment for Parcel to work, and fuzz &amp; monitors the serialization and deserialization procedures for mismatches.

We evaluate PMdet with several firmware from different Android vendors, and the results show that PMdet can detect Parcel Mismatch bugs of different causes, including 11 unique undisclosed mismatches, 6 of which are exploitable, and other 5 bugs that have been already confirmed and fixed.

  <summary>Secure Local Vault - Git Based Secret Manager</summary>
  Problem Statement:

At Companies secrets are being used across various environments for integration and authentication services. However, managing the secrets and preventing incidents from leakage of secrets have been challenging for the organisation. Existing solutions are centralised and warrants considerable code change to be implemented. Following are the problem statement to be resolved:



- To manage and secure the secrets that are currently in plain text across Git, IaC templates, and workloads.

- To implement a secrets manager that is developer friendly and reduces operational overheads.

- To develop a solution that does not expose the secrets even at the compromise of entities storing the credentials. For example, to protect our secrets from CodeCov like incidents.



Solution:

We have developed a Git based secret manager which adopts a secure and decentralised approach to managing, sharing, and storing the secrets. In this approach secrets are stored in an encrypted form in Github repositories of the teams. 



Keys Principles

This implementation follows two important principles

-A developer can be allowed to add or modify secrets, however should not be allowed to view them

-An environment should have a single identity that gives access to all necessary credentials irrespective of the number of projects that are deployed.

  <summary>Efidrill â€”â€”Automated Hunting UEFI Firmware Vulnerability through Data-Flow Analysis</summary>
  UEFI, an early stage in the computer booting process, is susceptible to attacks that disrupt the Secure Boot security mechanism , thereby allowing attackers to inject a type of malicious software known as "UEFI Rootkit." This specialized strain of malware adeptly conceals itself within SMM or BootLoader, granting malevolent actors surreptitious control over a victim's computer for a prolonged period.

Amidst ongoing research into UEFI security, researchers have discovered numerous SMM vulnerabilities, enhancing the robustness of UEFI. Remarkably, the emergence of tools like "efiexplorer" has significantlystreamlined the reverse engineering process for UEFI firmware.

Yet, contentment with the status quo proves untenable. Many latent UEFI vulnerabilities evade conventional detection techniques, with existing UEFI vulnerability detection tools primarily relying on fuzz testing or assembly instruction matching. Regrettably, no publicly available tool exists that can automatically detect and discover UEFI security vulnerabilities through data flow tracking analysis.

Efidrill - The First Open-Source IDA Plugin for Data Flow Analysis of UEFI Firmware.

Efidrill is a tool that enables data flow tracing, taint tracking, automated structure analysis, variable numerical prediction, and automated vulnerability detection for UEFI firmware.

  <summary>ELFieScanner: Advanced process memory threat detection on Linux</summary>
  ELFieScanner looks to address the relative scarcity and immaturity of non-invasive portable in-memory malware scanning capabilities on Linux. It provides detections with greater context and thus value to the investigative capabilities of blue teams.



ELFieScanner inspects live process memory to detect a number of malicious techniques used by threat actors and in particular those which have been incorporated into Linux based user-mode rootkits. ELFieScanner inspects every running process (both x86/x64) and its corresponding loaded shared objects (libraries) to look for evil. It then outputs resultant detection telemetry into a format that can be easily ingested into a SEIM and viewed by Threat hunters or IR consultants. It has been designed to be both low impact and portable to work across numerous Linux distributions both old and new.



ELFieScanner uses 43 custom built and configurable memory heuristics that are constructed through live in-depth binary analysis of both the process image and a corresponding disk backed binary (if present), using this to identify malevolence. It offers four main detection capabilities that identify:

â€¢	Shared Object injection techniques.

â€¢	Entry point manipulation techniques.

â€¢	Shellcode injection and Process hollowing.

â€¢	API Hooking.



The scanner uses a low impact technique of memory collection that doesn't require interrupts to be sent to remote processes, thereby remaining passive and overcoming ptrace() anti-debug techniques used by malware. The configurability of the binary heuristics provides Blue teams a way to tailor the sensitivity of the detections for their particular environment if used as a persistent monitoring solution; or for incident responders to amass as many suspicious events as possible in one-time collection scenarios. In addition, a portable build is also provided overcoming the unwanted and intrusive default Linux behaviour of building tools on host.

  <summary>BucketLoot - An Automated S3 Bucket Inspector</summary>
  Thousands of S3 buckets are left exposed over the internet, making it a prime target for malicious actors who may extract sensitive information from the files in these buckets that can be associated with an individual or an organisation. There is limited research or tooling available that leverages such S3 buckets for looking up secret exposures and searching specific keywords or regular expression patterns within textual files.



BucketLoot is an automated S3 Bucket Inspector that can simultaneously scan all the textual files present within an exposed S3 bucket from platforms such as AWS, DigitalOcean etc.



It scans the exposed textual files for:

- Secret Exposures

- Assets (URLs, Domains, Subdomains)

- Specific keywords | Regex Patterns (provided by the user)



The end user can even search for string based keywords or provide custom regular expression patterns that can be matched with the contents of these exposed textual files.



All of this makes BucketLoot a great recon tool for bug hunters as well as professional pentesters.



The tool allows users to save the output in a JSON format which makes it easier to pass the results as an input to some third-party product or platform.

  <summary>Monitoring and Detecting Leaks with GitAlerts</summary>
  Most organisations put significant effort into maintaining their public GitHub repositories. They safeguard these repositories against various security vulnerabilities and routinely scan for sensitive information, ensuring thorough checks have been carried out before making anything public. However, an aspect that is often overlooked is the monitoring of the public activities of their organisation's users.



Developers within organisations frequently experiment and test ideas in a public setting, which may inadvertently include sensitive code, hardcoded credentials, secrets, internal URLs, and other proprietary information. This oversight can lead to significant security risks, making it crucial for organisations to monitor such activities to prevent potential data breaches.



Recent studies on data breaches reveal a startling trend. The leakage of secrets and sensitive information often occurs via individual repositories, rather than organisational ones. This fact underscores the importance of monitoring not just the organisation's repositories but also those created and maintained by individual users.



This talk aims to shed light on such cases related to GitHub. We will delve into real-world examples, discuss the common pitfalls, and suggest effective strategies to guard against these potential security risks.

  <summary>.NET Unpacking: When Frida Gets the JIT out of It</summary>
  .NET-based malware families (like AgentTesla, CrimsonRat, and MassLogger, to list a few) can include obfuscation or packing that would harden analysts' work to understand and mitigate these threats effectively. Several options exist for researchers to tackle this challenge such as (but not limited to ) De4Dot, JITM (Mandiant 2020), DotDumper (Black Hat 2022), or JitHook (JSAC 2023) ... However, those solutions either don't cover the case where CLR APIs are intercepted by the packer, or do it in a very limited way. Our new tool has been developed to address this issue, adding some notable advancements that hopefully will prove its utility in the field of malware analysis.

Our Frida-Jit-unPacker (FJP) tool uses a passive, less intrusive approach than previous tools, making it less likely to be detected by anti-unpacking-features. It is developed using Python3 and Frida and doesn't impose restrictions on the .NET framework version associated with the sample. The tool is not focused on specific packers, making it generic and flexible. 

One of its improvements compared to previously listed tools is its ability to also recover and fix original tokens from encrypted ones.

In addition, this tool employs several strategies to be more covert in its operations compared to existing solutions. It achieves this by focusing on intercepting lower-level functions, less likely to set off anti-unpacking mechanisms typically employed by packers. This stealthy approach is further enhanced by disassembling the Common Language Runtime (CLR) - strategically placing hooks just before or after likely monitoring points, tactically reducing the chances of triggering packers' anti-unpacking mechanisms.

These enhancements aim to assist analysts and researchers in the evolving 'cat and mouse' game of malware code protection. Hopefully, the tool will prove to be a valuable addition to the researchers' arsenal.
