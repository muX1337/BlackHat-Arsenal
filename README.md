# BlackHat-Arsenal
Covers the Arsenal of the BlackHat-Events in ASIA/EU/USA/MEA

# Info

Last year I've created a repository of the Arsenal which where presented at the BlackHat EU 2021. In this repository I'll gonna continue it for the BlackHat Asia/US/EU. 
Here is already a good list https://github.com/toolswatch/blackhat-arsenal-tools but I do it mostly for myself to check weather a tool might be useful for me or not and I like to share it with you. If you find any missing links/repositories or any useful information don't hesitate to contact me. Thanks

# Crawler

Quickly written crawler to fetch description and summaries.

Updated using playwright and selenium as fallback
```
# in your venv
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# then install Playwright browser binaries
python -m playwright install chromium
```

Otherwise chromedriver must be in the path to work
