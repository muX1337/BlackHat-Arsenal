# BlackHat-Arsenal
Covers the Arsenal of the BlackHat-Events in ASIA/EU/USA/MEA

# Info

Last year I've created a repository of the Arsenal which where presented at the BlackHat EU 2021. In this reposotory I'll gonna continue it for the BlackHat Asia/US/EU. 
Here is already a good list https://github.com/toolswatch/blackhat-arsenal-tools but I do it mostly for myself to check weather a tool might be useful for me or not and I like to share it with you. If you find any missing links/repositories or any useful information don't hesitate to contact me. Thanks
